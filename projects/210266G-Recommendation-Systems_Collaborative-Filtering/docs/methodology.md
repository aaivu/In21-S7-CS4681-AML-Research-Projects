## 1. Overview

This document provides a detailed description of the methodology employed in the development and evaluation of **ContentGCN**, a novel hybrid graph-based recommendation model. The core objective of this research is to enhance the state-of-the-art LightGCN model by addressing its inherent limitation of being "content-blind." Our methodology involves integrating rich item content features into the GCN framework through a sophisticated and adaptive fusion architecture. The final model incorporates a hybrid embedding structure, a learnable gating mechanism to balance content and collaborative signals, and a composite loss function with an auxiliary content regularization term. This document outlines the research design, data processing pipeline, model architecture, and experimental setup used to validate our approach.

## 2. Research Design

The research follows a quantitative, comparative experimental design aimed at demonstrating a measurable performance improvement over a strong baseline. The design consists of four primary stages:

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** Implement and evaluate the state-of-the-art LightGCN model on a preprocessed, real-world dataset to establish a robust performance benchmark.
2.  **Novel Architecture Development:** Design and implement the ContentGCN model, which extends LightGCN with several architectural enhancements designed to fuse item content features with the collaborative filtering process.
3.  **Comparative Evaluation:** Train both the baseline and the ContentGCN model under similar conditions and compare their performance using standard recommendation quality metrics (Recall@20, NDCG@20).
4.  **Component Validation:** Conduct a rigorous ablation study to isolate and quantify the contribution of the key innovative components of the ContentGCN architecture, specifically the gating mechanism and the auxiliary content loss.

This design ensures that any observed performance gains can be directly attributed to the novel components of our proposed methodology.

## 3. Data Collection

### 3.1 Data Sources
The project utilizes the publicly available **Last.fm Dataset**. This dataset is ideal for this research as it contains two essential components:
1.  **User-Item Interactions:** A large log of user listening habits (user-track pairs), representing implicit feedback.
2.  **Item Metadata:** A supplementary file containing rich content features for the music tracks, including genre, year, and various audio--derived features.

### 3.2 Data Description
-   **Interactions Data:** Provided as `train.csv`, `val.csv`, and `test.csv`. Each row contains a `user_id`, a `track_id`, and a `playcount`. For our BPR-based approach, we treat any interaction as a positive implicit signal.
-   **Content Data:** Provided as `music.csv`. Each row corresponds to a `track_id` and contains numerous features, including numerical attributes (e.g., `year`, `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`) and categorical attributes (e.g., `genre`).

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing
A multi-step data preprocessing pipeline was essential for ensuring model stability and robust evaluation.

1.  **Interaction Data Cleaning:** The raw interaction data was sparse and contained many users and items with very few interactions. To create a more robust dataset for learning, we iteratively filtered the combined dataset to ensure every user and item had a minimum of **5 interactions**. This "warm-start" dataset prevents evaluation issues with users or items that have no representation in the training graph.

2.  **Train-Validation-Test Splitting:** After cleaning, the data was re-split into new training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. This split was performed on a per-user basis to ensure a consistent distribution of user histories. Critically, this process guarantees that all users and items present in the validation and test sets are also present in the training set, which was a key step to resolve initial evaluation errors.

3.  **Content Feature Engineering:** The `music.csv` file was processed to create a feature matrix aligned with the items in the training data.
    * **Numerical Features:** Twelve numerical features were selected. Missing values were imputed with the feature's mean. All features were then normalized to a [0, 1] range using Min-Max scaling.
    * **Categorical Features:** The `genre` feature was one-hot encoded to create a binary vector representation. Missing genre tags were assigned a dedicated 'unknown' category.
    * The final numerical and categorical feature vectors were concatenated to form a single content feature matrix $\mathbf{C}$.

## 4. Model Architecture

The proposed ContentGCN model builds upon the LightGCN framework, integrating several novel components to enable effective content fusion.



1.  **Content Feature Projection:** A standard `nn.Linear` layer is used as a projection head. It takes the high-dimensional content feature matrix $\mathbf{C}$ as input and projects it into the main $d$-dimensional embedding space. This results in a content-derived embedding for every item, $\mathbf{E}_{content}$.

2.  **Hybrid Item Embedding:** The model maintains two distinct sources of item representation:
    * **Collaborative Embedding ($\mathbf{E}_{collab}$):** A standard, learnable `nn.Embedding` layer that captures interaction patterns from the graph structure. It is initialized randomly.
    * **Content Embedding ($\mathbf{E}_{content}$):** The output of the content projection layer described above.

3.  **Gated Fusion Mechanism:** This is the core innovation of our architecture. A small gating network (a linear layer followed by a `Sigmoid` activation) takes the raw content features $\mathbf{C}$ as input and outputs a scalar gate value $\alpha_i \in [0, 1]$ for each item. This gate value adaptively controls the fusion of the two embedding sources:
    
    $\mathbf{E}_{items} = (1 - \boldsymbol{\alpha}) \odot \mathbf{E}_{collab} + \boldsymbol{\alpha} \odot \mathbf{E}_{content}$
    
    This allows the model to learn to rely more on content for items with sparse interactions and more on the collaborative signal for popular, well-represented items.

4.  **Regularized Graph Propagation:** The final hybrid item embeddings, along with a standard learnable user embedding, are passed through a multi-layer GCN propagation module. To stabilize training, we enhance the simple LightGCN propagation with:
    * **Residual Connections:** The output of each GCN layer is added to its input, preventing over-smoothing.
    * **Layer Normalization:** Applied after each propagation step.
    * **Dropout:** Applied to embeddings before the propagation begins.

5.  **Hybrid Loss Function:** The model is trained using a composite loss function. The primary component is the **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) Loss**, which optimizes for the relative ranking of positive and negative items. To this, we add an **auxiliary content loss** (MSE), which penalizes the model if the final, refined item embeddings drift too far from their initial content-based projections. This acts as a regularizer, ensuring the embeddings remain grounded in content.

## 5. Experimental Setup

### 5.1 Evaluation Metrics
The performance of all models is evaluated using two standard top-K ranking metrics:
-   **Recall@20:** Measures the proportion of relevant items for a user that are found in the top-20 recommendations. It evaluates the model's ability to "discover" relevant items.
-   **NDCG@20 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain):** A metric that evaluates the ranking quality of the recommendations. It rewards models for placing more relevant items higher up in the list.

### 5.2 Baseline Models
-   **LightGCN:** Our primary baseline is a highly optimized implementation of the state-of-the-art LightGCN model.
-   **Ablation Variants:** To validate our design choices, we also compare against two variants of our own model: one without the gating mechanism and one without the auxiliary content loss.

### 5.3 Hardware/Software Requirements
-   **Language/Frameworks:** Python 3, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
-   **Hardware:** All experiments were conducted on a Google Colab instance with GPU acceleration (NVIDIA T4).

## 6. Implementation Plan

The implementation followed an iterative, four-phase plan.

| Phase   | Tasks                                                                 | Duration | Deliverables                                  |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Data Preprocessing & Baseline Implementation                          | 2 weeks  | Cleaned dataset, working LightGCN model       |

## 7. Risk Analysis

Several risks were identified and mitigated during the implementation phase.

-   **Risk 1: Data Quality and Cold-Start Issues:** Initial experiments produced `nan` values for evaluation metrics due to users/items in the validation/test sets not being present in the training set.
    -   **Mitigation:** A robust data preprocessing script was implemented to filter the data and create clean, consistent train/val/test splits, which completely resolved the issue.

-   **Risk 2: Memory Overload During Training:** The initial negative sampling strategy, which pre-computed all training triplets for an epoch, caused Google Colab to run out of RAM and crash.
    -   **Mitigation:** The data loading pipeline was re-implemented using a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class (`BPRDataset`) that performs "just-in-time" negative sampling for each batch, drastically reducing memory consumption.

-   **Risk 3: Negative Initial Results:** The first, simpler versions of the hybrid model underperformed compared to the strong LightGCN baseline.
    -   **Mitigation:** The methodology was iteratively refined. The introduction of the gating mechanism and the auxiliary content loss were direct responses to these initial negative results, ultimately leading to the final, successful architecture.

## 8. Expected Outcomes
