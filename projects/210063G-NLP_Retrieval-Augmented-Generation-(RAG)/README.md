## Getting Started

1. **Complete Research Proposal:** Fill out `docs/research_proposal.md`
2. **Literature Review:** Document your literature review in `docs/literature_review.md`
3. **Set Up Environment:** Add your dependencies to `requirements.txt`
4. **Start Coding:** Begin implementation in the `src/` folder
5. **Track Progress:** Use GitHub Issues to report weekly progress

## Milestones

- [ ] **Week 5-6:** Finalize the literature review and complete the initial design of the Agentic LightRAG
 architecture. Begin setting up the development environment and data preprocessing pipelines.
- [ ] **Week 7-8:**  Implement the core components of the multi-agent system, including the Query De
composition Agent and the specialized Retrieval Agents (Low-Level and High-Level).
- [ ] **Week 9-10:** Integrate the agentic system with the graph-based knowledge index. Develop and
 refine the communication protocols between the agents.
- [ ] **Week 11-12:** Implement the Answer Synthesis Agent. Conduct initial experiments on benchmark
 datasets and begin iterative debugging and performance tuning.
- [ ] **Week 13-14:**  Complete the final evaluation, analyze the results, and write the final project report.
