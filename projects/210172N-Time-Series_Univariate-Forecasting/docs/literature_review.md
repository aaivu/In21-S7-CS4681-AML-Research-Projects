## Abstract

This literature review examines the evolution of time series forecasting from traditional statistical methods to modern deep learning approaches, with particular emphasis on Transformer-based architectures and their efficient deployment. The review establishes a research gap between modern Long-Term Series Forecasting (LTSF) models and classic large-scale benchmarks like the M4 Competition, motivating the focus on achieving competitive accuracy with dramatically improved real-time performance through quantization, model compression, and optimization techniques. Key findings indicate that 10-50x speedup is achievable with minimal accuracy degradation (1-2%) through proven strategies including 4-bit quantization (AWQ, GPTQ), ONNX Runtime optimizations, and efficient ensemble methods.

## 1. Introduction

The field of time series forecasting has undergone a significant paradigm shift with the advent of deep learning models based on the Transformer architecture [1]. While traditional statistical methods and hybrid approaches dominated classical benchmarks like the M4 Competition, recent pure deep learning models have demonstrated competitive or superior performance. However, a critical research gap exists between the sophisticated Transformer-based models optimized for long-term forecasting and the practical requirements of real-time deployment on resource-constrained environments. This review synthesizes current research on efficient time series forecasting, examining both model architecture innovations and post-training optimization techniques that enable production deployment without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 The M4 Competition and Classical Forecasting Benchmarks

The M4 Competition represents a longstanding and significant challenge in the forecasting community, comprising 100,000 diverse univariate time series from various domains requiring multi-horizon forecasting [2]. A key finding from the competition was that the most accurate methods were predominantly combinations of statistical approaches or hybrid models. Notably, the six pure Machine Learning methods submitted performed poorly, with none surpassing the combination benchmark. This established a high bar for any pure deep learning model attempting to compete in this domain.

The dataset structure presents unique challenges: 48,000 monthly series (the largest subset), 24,000 quarterly series, 23,000 yearly series, and smaller subsets of weekly (359), daily (4,227), and hourly (414) series. The diversity in series length and frequency requires adaptive modeling strategies, with yearly series being particularly challenging due to limited observations (as few as 13 points with 6-step forecast horizons).

**Key Papers:**
- Makridakis et al. (2018) - "The M4 Competition: Results, findings, conclusion and way forward" - Established benchmark performance and revealed that pure ML methods underperformed hybrid approaches [2]

### 3.2 The Deep Learning Breakthrough: N-BEATS

The narrative that pure deep learning models were unsuitable for the M4 benchmark was challenged by the N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for interpretable Time Series forecasting) model [3]. N-BEATS was the first pure deep learning model to outperform the M4 competition winner, a domain-adjusted hybrid model. The architecture is based on backward and forward residual links (doubly residual stacking) and employs a very deep stack of fully-connected layers without requiring recurrence or attention mechanisms.

N-BEATS demonstrated that deep architecture could effectively solve a wide range of forecasting problems without task-specific feature engineering, achieving an 11% improvement over statistical benchmarks and 3% improvement over the previous year's winner. This proved the viability of pure deep learning in the M4 domain and established a new high-performance benchmark. The model's success highlights that heavily compressed transformers removing some attention mechanisms could still perform well, as N-BEATS achieves competitive results with pure feed-forward networks.

### 3.3 The Transformer Revolution in Deep Learning

The introduction of the Transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. fundamentally changed the landscape of sequence modeling across multiple domains [1]. The paper "Attention Is All You Need" proposed a novel architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. This self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when making predictions, providing both improved performance and better interpretability.

The Transformer's impact extends far beyond its original natural language processing application, becoming the foundational architecture for large language models and, subsequently, time series forecasting models. However, the quadratic complexity of standard attention (O(n²) in sequence length) presents significant computational challenges for long sequences, motivating subsequent research into efficient attention mechanisms.

**Key Papers:**
- Vaswani et al. (2017) - "Attention Is All You Need" (arXiv:1706.03762) - Introduced the Transformer architecture that became foundational for modern deep learning, including time series applications [1]

### 3.4 Evolution of Transformers for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting

In parallel with general Transformer development, research focused specifically on the Long-Term Series Forecasting (LTSF) problem has produced several notable architectures. Reformer [4] addressed the computational complexity issue by utilizing Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to achieve near-linear complexity (O(L log L) instead of O(L²)). This approach groups similar queries and keys using hash functions, reducing the number of attention computations required.

Informer [5] introduced a ProbSparse attention mechanism operating under the assumption that only a few key-query pairs are significant for prediction. This selective attention approach achieved O(L log L) time complexity and memory usage while maintaining competitive forecasting accuracy. Informer was recognized with the AAAI 2021 Best Paper award for its contributions to efficient long-sequence time series forecasting.

However, the work of Zeng et al. [6] challenged the necessity of such complex architectures, demonstrating that simple linear models (LTSF-Linear) could outperform sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models across nine real-life datasets, often by large margins. Their core argument centered on the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism inevitably causing temporal information loss despite positional encoding attempts. This provocative result highlighted that architectural complexity does not guarantee superior performance and motivated research into simpler, more effective approaches.

### 3.5 PatchTST: Simplicity and Effectiveness Through Patching

The PatchTST model [7] provided a powerful response to the simplicity-versus-complexity debate by introducing "patching" as an input representation technique, making a vanilla Transformer backbone highly effective again. Accepted at ICLR 2023, PatchTST segments time series into subseries-level patches that serve as input tokens to the Transformer, combined with channel-independence where each univariate series shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all series.

The patching design provides three key benefits: (1) local semantic information is retained in patch embeddings, (2) computation and memory usage of attention maps are quadratically reduced for the same look-back window, and (3) the model can attend to longer historical contexts. Compared to previous Transformer-based models, PatchTST achieves 20-21% reduction in MSE and 16-17% reduction in MAE while requiring significantly less computation.

This philosophy of simplicity combined with appropriate data representation makes PatchTST a compelling candidate for adaptation to the M4 benchmark. The model's success demonstrates that architectural innovation need not involve complex attention mechanisms; rather, thoughtful input tokenization can unlock the full potential of standard Transformer architectures.

### 3.6 Model Quantization: From 8-bit to 2-bit Precision

Post-training quantization has matured significantly in 2023-2025, with 4-bit quantization becoming production-standard for transformer deployments. SmoothQuant [8] pioneered effective W8A8 (8-bit weights and activations) quantization for large language models by migrating quantization difficulty from activations to weights through mathematically equivalent per-channel scaling. The method achieves less than 0.5% accuracy degradation while providing up to 1.56x speedup and 2x memory reduction for models ranging from OPT-175B to MT-NLG 530B.

AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) [9] advanced the field further by enabling viable 4-bit quantization through protection of salient weights—just 0.1-1% of parameters that contribute most to model output based on activation magnitudes. Recognized with the MLSys 2024 Best Paper Award, AWQ achieves 2.7-2.9x speedup on edge GPUs (NVIDIA Jetson Orin) versus FP16 with near-zero quality degradation. The method has been integrated into major frameworks including Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, and TensorRT-LLM, demonstrating its production readiness.

For extreme compression scenarios, QuIP# [10] enables viable 2-bit quantization using incoherence processing with Hadamard transforms and E₈ lattice codebooks. Presented at ICML 2024, QuIP# maintains small quality gaps compared to 4-bit quantization for models over 2B parameters, though with 3-5% accuracy degradation. This represents the frontier of weight-only quantization, trading additional accuracy loss for extreme memory efficiency.

### 3.7 ONNX Runtime and Deployment Optimization

Converting models to ONNX format and leveraging ONNX Runtime optimizations enables dramatic CPU inference acceleration, with 4-17x speedup over PyTorch on CPU making real-time forecasting feasible on modest hardware. ONNX Runtime applies three optimization levels, with Level 2 (Extended) being most critical for transformers through fusion of attention operations, LayerNormalization, and GELU activations. These fusions reduce memory bandwidth by 6x and provide 2-4x speedup over PyTorch implementations.

Recent ONNX Runtime developments (2024) include WebGPU backend support enabling browser-based inference, NPU support via Qualcomm AI Engine for edge devices achieving ~100ms time-to-first-token, and multi-LoRA support enabling runtime adapter switching with 4x memory reduction. Combined with dynamic INT8 quantization, ONNX Runtime achieves 10-15x total speedup for transformer models, reducing BERT-base inference from 30-40ms (PyTorch) to 2-3ms (ONNX Runtime + INT8).

**Key Resources:**
- ONNX Runtime documentation and optimization guides - Demonstrated 4-17x CPU speedup through graph optimization and operator fusion
- Microsoft Transformer Optimization Tool - Enables offline optimization achieving 6-10x faster inference on CPU versus PyTorch

### 3.8 Model Compression Through Pruning and Distillation

Structured pruning removes entire attention heads or feed-forward neurons, providing direct speedup without specialized hardware. Research demonstrates that transformers can tolerate pruning 30-50% of attention heads with minimal accuracy impact (<1% degradation), while FFN layers require more careful importance scoring due to higher sensitivity. The practical recommendation prioritizes structured pruning for deployment efficiency, targeting 40-50% parameter reduction for conservative compression or 70-80% for aggressive compression.

Knowledge distillation enables compression of larger teacher models into smaller student models while retaining most performance. DistilBERT [11] achieved 40% parameter reduction while retaining 97% of BERT's performance through distillation during both pre-training and fine-tuning, using three objectives: embedding layer distillation, attention matrix distillation, and hidden state distillation. This approach demonstrates that model size can be substantially reduced without proportional performance loss when leveraging teacher model knowledge.

Low-rank factorization through LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) [12] offers exceptional parameter efficiency for fine-tuning scenarios common in time series. With rank r=8, LoRA achieves 10,000x reduction in trainable parameters for GPT-3 175B while maintaining on-par or better performance than full fine-tuning. For PatchTST deployment, LoRA applied to attention Q and V projections enables efficient adaptation to different M4 frequency subsets with the option to merge weights for zero inference overhead.

### 3.9 Efficient Ensemble Methods

Efficient ensemble methods provide accuracy gains without proportional inference cost increases. Snapshot Ensembles [13] train one network that converges to multiple local minima by using cyclic learning rate schedules, saving model snapshots at each minimum. The learning rate cycles from high to low over 20-40 epochs per snapshot, with total training time equal to single model training. Ensembling 5 snapshots provides 1-2% improvement over the best single model with zero additional training cost.

Fast Geometric Ensembling (FGE) [14] improves on snapshot ensembles by traversing the loss surface along low-loss paths connecting model optima. Using optimized cyclical learning rates, FGE achieves an additional 0.3-0.8% improvement over snapshot ensembles with minimal additional training epochs.

Model Soups [15] offer the most deployment-efficient ensemble approach by averaging weights of multiple models fine-tuned with different hyperparameters into a single model with no additional inference or memory cost. Presented at ICML 2022, the greedy soup recipe sequentially adds models only if validation accuracy improves, achieving 0.5-2% improvements over the best single model. For PatchTST deployment, training 5-10 models with different random seeds and dropout rates, then creating a greedy soup provides production-ready accuracy improvements without inference overhead.

### 3.10 Efficient Attention Mechanisms

Linear attention mechanisms reduce complexity from O(n²) to O(n) by reordering operations: computing (QK^T)V as Q(K^T V) enables much longer sequences. Performer [16] achieves linear complexity with theoretical guarantees using FAVOR+ (Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features) to approximate softmax kernels. This approach delivers 1.5-3x speedup with 0.5-2% accuracy loss while maintaining provable unbiased estimation of attention matrices.

For time series with strong local patterns, local/windowed attention attending only to nearby tokens within a fixed window achieves 2-4x speedup with just 0.5-1% accuracy loss. This is particularly suitable for PatchTST where patches already capture local semantic information, making global attention across all patches less critical.

iTransformer [17] introduced a fundamentally different approach by inverting the tokenization strategy: applying attention over variate tokens instead of temporal tokens. Presented as an ICLR 2024 Spotlight paper, iTransformer better captures multivariate correlations with more interpretable attention maps. While designed for multivariate forecasting, the principle of dimension inversion offers insights for improving univariate model efficiency.

### 3.11 Time Series Foundation Models

Time series foundation models represent a paradigm shift toward zero-shot forecasting without task-specific training. Timer [18], accepted at ICML 2024, is a generative pre-trained transformer trained on up to 1 billion time points. It employs Single-series Sequence (S3) format for unified representation across forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection tasks, offering zero-shot capabilities without GPU requirements for inference.

TimesFM [19], developed by Google Research and presented at ICML 2024, provides a 200M parameter decoder-only model pre-trained on 100 billion time points. The model uses patch-based tokenization with variable context and horizon lengths, achieving zero-shot performance approaching supervised state-of-the-art. TimesFM ranked among top-3 models on Monash datasets and performed within statistical significance of best methods on Darts benchmarks.

These foundation models fundamentally change the deployment calculus: instead of training PatchTST from scratch, practitioners can fine-tune Timer or TimesFM on domain-specific data for faster convergence and better generalization. The pre-trained representations capture universal temporal patterns that transfer well to new domains, reducing training time from days to hours while achieving competitive accuracy.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

### Gap 1: Efficient PatchTST Deployment on M4 Benchmark

**Description:** While PatchTST demonstrates excellent performance on LTSF benchmarks, and modern quantization techniques achieve dramatic speedups on large language models, no existing work has systematically applied state-of-the-art compression and optimization techniques to PatchTST for the M4 Competition benchmark. The M4 dataset's unique characteristics (100,000 diverse series, multiple frequencies, very short series) require specialized adaptations not addressed in current PatchTST literature.

**Why it matters:** The M4 benchmark remains the gold standard for univariate forecasting evaluation, with its scale and diversity providing rigorous testing of model generalization. Achieving competitive accuracy with 10-50x speedup would enable real-time forecasting for large-scale production deployments on CPU hardware, democratizing access to state-of-the-art forecasting capabilities without expensive GPU infrastructure.

**How this research addresses it:** By systematically applying proven quantization strategies (AWQ 4-bit, SmoothQuant INT8), ONNX Runtime optimizations, and efficient ensemble methods (Model Soups) to PatchTST specifically adapted for M4 data characteristics, this research provides a practical implementation guide for deploying efficient transformers on classical benchmarks. The focus on the M4 monthly subset (48,000 series) within a 12-week timeline demonstrates feasibility for academic research projects.

### Gap 2: Adaptive Patching for Variable-Length Time Series

**Description:** Current PatchTST implementations use fixed patch sizes (typically 16 points with stride 8) optimized for long sequences. However, M4 yearly series can be as short as 13 observations, making standard patching ineffective. No existing work provides comprehensive adaptive patching strategies that scale with series length while maintaining model efficiency.

**Why it matters:** Variable-length series are common in real-world forecasting scenarios (quarterly earnings, annual surveys, irregular observations). Developing principled adaptive patching approaches extends PatchTST's applicability beyond long-sequence domains to the broader forecasting landscape where observation frequency varies.

**How this research addresses it:** Implementing dynamic patching strategies that scale patch_length and stride with series length (patch_length = max(2, series_length // 10) for short series) enables effective tokenization across M4's diverse frequency subsets. This approach maintains the benefits of patching (reduced attention complexity, local semantic capture) while adapting to data constraints.

### Gap 3: Quantization-Aware Training for Time Series Transformers

**Description:** While extensive quantization research exists for large language models, time series models exhibit different activation patterns and sensitivity profiles. The temporal dependencies and distribution shifts common in time series (non-stationarity, seasonality changes) may require specialized quantization calibration strategies not addressed in NLP-focused quantization literature.

**Why it matters:** Blindly applying LLM quantization techniques to time series models risks higher accuracy degradation than necessary. Understanding time series-specific quantization sensitivities enables optimal compression-accuracy tradeoffs, potentially achieving better results than generic quantization approaches.

**How this research addresses it:** Through careful empirical evaluation of quantization calibration strategies (moving average min-max observers for temporal patterns, calibration dataset selection covering different seasons and volatility regimes), this research identifies time series-specific best practices that complement existing quantization frameworks.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

This research operates within a multi-disciplinary theoretical framework integrating:

**1. Attention Mechanisms and Transformers:** The self-attention mechanism's ability to model long-range dependencies in sequences provides the foundation for effective time series forecasting. PatchTST's patching approach reduces the effective sequence length, making standard attention computationally tractable while preserving information content.

**2. Information Theory and Quantization:** Quantization fundamentally involves information compression, trading bit-precision for computational efficiency. The success of 4-bit quantization in preserving model performance suggests that neural network weights contain significant redundancy, with salient weights (as identified by AWQ) capturing most predictive power.

**3. Loss Surface Geometry:** Modern understanding of neural network loss surfaces reveals that high-performing optima lie in connected low-loss regions (mode connectivity). This geometric insight enables efficient ensemble methods (FGE, Snapshot Ensembles) that traverse these regions to collect diverse yet accurate models.

**4. Transfer Learning and Foundation Models:** Pre-training on large diverse datasets enables models to learn universal patterns transferable to downstream tasks. For time series, foundation models (Timer, TimesFM) capture fundamental temporal dynamics (trends, seasonality, autocorrelation) that generalize across domains, reducing the need for domain-specific architectures.

**5. Compression-Performance Tradeoffs:** The principle that model capacity can be substantially reduced (through pruning, distillation, quantization) with minimal performance loss suggests that neural networks are typically over-parameterized. Identifying and preserving critical parameters while removing redundant capacity forms the core of efficient deployment.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Based on the literature review, several methodological insights emerge for efficient PatchTST deployment on M4:

**Model Architecture:** Start with a small-to-medium PatchTST configuration (d_model=128-256, n_layers=3-6, n_heads=8-16) yielding 1-5M parameters, which fits comfortably in 16GB GPU memory and trains in 20-40 GPU hours for the monthly subset.

**Training Strategy:** Employ mixed precision (FP16) training with gradient accumulation to simulate large batch sizes, use curriculum learning starting with longer series then adding shorter ones, and implement self-supervised pre-training with masked patch prediction for better generalization.

**Quantization Pipeline:** Follow the conservative path of INT8 quantization initially (SmoothQuant or dynamic quantization via ONNX Runtime), targeting <1% accuracy degradation with 4x compression and 1.5-2x speedup. If successful, advance to 4-bit AWQ quantization for 6-7x compression and 2-3x speedup with 1-2% degradation.

**Optimization Workflow:** Convert trained PyTorch model to ONNX with opset 14+, apply Level 2 graph optimizations (attention fusion, LayerNorm fusion), perform static INT8 quantization with 200-500 calibration samples, and deploy via ONNX Runtime with appropriate thread configuration for target CPU hardware.

**Ensemble Approach:** Train 5-10 models with different random seeds and dropout rates, create a greedy Model Soup by sequentially adding models that improve validation performance, and deploy the single averaged model with zero inference overhead.

**Benchmarking:** Use the official M4 evaluation framework computing sMAPE, MASE, and OWA metrics, compare against Naive2 baseline and published N-BEATS results, measure inference latency with proper warm-up and statistical aggregation, and report both accuracy metrics and computational efficiency.

## 7. Conclusion

The literature review reveals that deploying efficient PatchTST on the M4 benchmark is both technically feasible and practically valuable within a 12-week research timeline. The convergence of several research advances creates an opportune moment:

**Architectural Innovation:** PatchTST's patching mechanism provides an effective yet simple approach to time series Transformer modeling, achieving state-of-the-art LTSF performance while reducing computational complexity.

**Quantization Maturity:** The field has progressed from experimental 8-bit quantization to production-ready 4-bit methods (AWQ, GPTQ) with comprehensive framework support (Hugging Face Optimum, vLLM, ONNX Runtime), enabling straightforward implementation.

**Deployment Infrastructure:** ONNX Runtime's continuous improvements (graph optimization, quantization support, hardware acceleration) provide a robust platform for efficient CPU inference, democratizing access beyond GPU-equipped environments.

**Foundation Model Emergence:** Pre-trained time series models (Timer, TimesFM) offer alternative pathways to competitive performance through fine-tuning rather than training from scratch, potentially accelerating research timelines.

The identified research gaps—efficient M4 deployment, adaptive patching, time series-specific quantization—represent tractable problems addressable within academic project constraints. The realistic expectation of achieving 10x speedup (conservative INT8 quantization + ONNX optimization) to 30x speedup (moderate 4-bit quantization + structured pruning) with 1-3% accuracy degradation provides clear success criteria.

This research contributes to the broader goal of making state-of-the-art forecasting accessible in production environments where computational resources are constrained, latency requirements are stringent, and deployment costs are critical. By demonstrating that modern Transformer-based models can achieve both competitive accuracy and practical efficiency, this work bridges the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment.
