## 1. Overview

This research investigates the efficiency of modern Transformer-based attention mechanisms—**FlashAttention** and **Linear Attention (Performer)**—within compact Transformer models such as **DistilBERT**.  
The primary goal is to evaluate whether these mechanisms can enhance training efficiency, reduce memory consumption, and maintain competitive accuracy in text classification tasks relevant to educational AI applications (e.g., sentiment or feedback analysis).

The study aims to provide actionable insights into **scalable Transformer deployment** on resource-limited hardware (e.g., consumer GPUs) for educational data processing.

## 2. Research Design

A **comparative experimental design** is adopted. The baseline model (DistilBERT) is compared with three modified architectures integrating efficient attention mechanisms:

1. **FlashAttention model** – employs GPU-optimized exact attention kernels.  
2. **Linear Attention model** – uses kernel-based softmax approximations (Performer).  
3. **Hybrid model** – combines Flash and Linear Attention layers alternately.

Each model is trained and evaluated under identical configurations to ensure fair comparison.  
Quantitative analysis focuses on **accuracy, training time, and GPU memory usage**, supported by qualitative error inspection to understand model behavior.

## 3. Data Collection

### 3.1 Data Sources
The **IMDb Movie Reviews dataset** is used as the primary benchmark due to its balanced, large-scale labeled corpus for binary sentiment classification.

**Source:** Maas et al., ACL 2011  
**Repository:** [IMDb Dataset – Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

### 3.2 Data Description
- **Training samples:** 25,000  
- **Test samples:** 25,000  
- **Classes:** Positive / Negative sentiment  
- **Average text length:** ~200 words per review  

For experimental efficiency, a subset of **5,000 training** and **5,000 test samples** was initially used before scaling up to the full dataset.

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing
- Tokenization using **DistilBERT tokenizer** (max sequence length = 256).  
- Lowercasing and truncation/padding for uniform input lengths.  
- Removal of HTML tags, punctuation normalization, and stop-word filtering for consistency.  
- Dataset split into training, validation, and test sets (80/10/10).

## 4. Model Architecture

All experiments are built on **DistilBERT-base-uncased**, a six-layer Transformer encoder that retains 97% of BERT’s language understanding capabilities with 40% fewer parameters.  

### Variants:
- **Baseline:** Standard multi-head self-attention layers.  
- **FlashAttention:** Incorporates I/O-aware exact attention kernels that minimize GPU memory reads/writes through tiling and recomputation.  
- **Linear Attention:** Replaces softmax with kernel feature mappings ϕ(x), reducing time and space complexity from O(n²) to O(n).  
- **Hybrid:** Alternates between FlashAttention and Linear Attention layers to explore synergistic benefits.

All models are implemented in **PyTorch** using **HuggingFace Transformers**, with FlashAttention kernels integrated via **CUDA extensions**.

## 7. Risk Analysis

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Hardware limitations** | GPU memory constraints on Colab may limit batch size or sequence length. | Use gradient accumulation and mixed precision training. |
| **Implementation instability** | CUDA integration errors with FlashAttention kernels. | Validate kernel compatibility; fallback to PyTorch’s native efficient attention APIs. |
| **Overfitting on small datasets** | IMDb subset may lead to overfitting during tuning. | Use dropout, weight decay, and early stopping. |
| **Approximation accuracy loss** | Linear Attention may underperform in fine-grained tasks. | Combine hybrid layers to balance accuracy and efficiency. |
