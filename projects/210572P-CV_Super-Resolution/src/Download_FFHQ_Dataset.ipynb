    "### ⚠️ **Important Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Large Dataset Size**: The FFHQ image dataset is approximately **88 GB**. Ensure you have sufficient space in your Google Drive.\n",
    "2.  **Long Duration**: The entire download and transfer process can take **several hours**. It is highly recommended to use a **Colab Pro** subscription to prevent the session from timing out.\n",
    "3.  **Colab Disk Space**: A standard, free Colab instance may not have enough temporary disk space to hold the entire dataset before transferring. Colab Pro provides more disk space.\n",
