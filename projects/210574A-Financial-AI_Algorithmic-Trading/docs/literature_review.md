## Abstract

This literature review examines the current state of research on AI evaluation, specifically focusing on reasoning evaluation. Key areas covered include sentiment analysis in finance, the use of domain-specific models like FinBERT, and advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-5 for data augmentation. The review also identifies challenges related to data imbalance and overfitting in financial NLP tasks and explores methodologies for improving model robustness and generalization. Finally, it highlights gaps in research that this project aims to address, such as the need for effective data augmentation in financial sentiment analysis.

## 1. Introduction

The evaluation of AI models, particularly in reasoning tasks, is an essential aspect of ensuring their practical effectiveness and reliability. In recent years, AI models such as BERT and its domain-specific variants like FinBERT have been increasingly used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, particularly in specialized areas like finance. These models, while effective, often suffer from challenges such as data imbalance, overfitting, and the lack of domain-specific training data. This literature review focuses on the current methodologies, challenges, and opportunities in the field of AI evaluation for reasoning tasks, with a particular emphasis on sentiment analysis in finance.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Financial Sentiment Analysis

Research in this area has primarily focused on improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis models in the financial domain. Traditional sentiment analysis methods, including lexicon-based approaches and general machine learning techniques, often struggle with the specialized language of finance.

**Key Papers:**

- **Araci, D. (2019)** - Introduced FinBERT, a BERT-based model fine-tuned on financial text data to improve sentiment analysis performance in the finance domain.
- **Li, B., Hou, Y., & Che, W. (2022)** - Provided an overview of various data augmentation techniques in NLP, with a focus on their application in financial sentiment analysis.

### 3.2 Data Augmentation for Imbalanced Datasets

Data augmentation has emerged as a solution to address the issue of class imbalance in financial sentiment datasets. However, traditional methods like back-translation have limitations in generating diverse, domain-specific paraphrases.

**Key Papers:**

- **Zhang, Y., & Wang, Q. (2021)** - Discussed the application of generative models like GPT for data augmentation in sentiment analysis tasks, including finance.
- **Gao, T., & Yu, L. (2023)** - Explored the role of LLMs in augmenting training datasets by generating contextually relevant financial texts that preserve sentiment polarity.

### 3.3 Large Language Models (LLMs) in NLP

LLMs, such as GPT-5, have demonstrated remarkable performance in a variety of NLP tasks, including text generation, paraphrasing, and even sentiment analysis. These models offer an opportunity to generate high-quality synthetic data for training, addressing data scarcity and imbalance.

**Key Papers:**

- **Radford, A., et al. (2020)** - Introduced GPT-3, laying the foundation for subsequent models like GPT-5, which have proven effective in data augmentation tasks for specialized domains.
- **Brown, T. B., et al. (2022)** - Highlighted the scalability of LLMs and their potential for improving the quality and diversity of training data in NLP tasks.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

### Gap 1: Lack of Effective Augmentation for Minority Classes in Financial Sentiment Analysis

**Why it matters:** In financial sentiment analysis, the positive and negative sentiment classes are often underrepresented compared to the neutral class, leading to biased models that perform poorly on minority sentiments.
**How your project addresses it:** This project explores the use of GPT-5 to generate synthetic data specifically for the minority classes, balancing the dataset and improving model performance.

### Gap 2: Insufficient Generalization of Financial Models to Unseen Data

**Why it matters:** Many financial sentiment models, including FinBERT, struggle to generalize to new, unseen financial datasets, especially when the training data is limited or imbalanced.
**How your project addresses it:** By using LLM-driven data augmentation, this project aims to expand the training dataset, improving generalization to a broader range of financial texts.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

This research is grounded in the theories of **transfer learning** and **domain adaptation**. Transfer learning enables the fine-tuning of pre-trained models like BERT for specific tasks, while domain adaptation focuses on tailoring models to specialized fields, such as finance, by incorporating domain-specific knowledge. The theoretical framework for this research involves applying these theories to augment FinBERT using synthetic data generated by LLMs, enhancing its performance in financial sentiment analysis.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Common methodologies used in this area include:

- **Fine-tuning pre-trained models**: Leveraging large-scale models like BERT and its variants (e.g., FinBERT) for domain-specific tasks.
- **Data augmentation**: Techniques like paraphrasing and back-translation, with a focus on using LLMs to generate domain-relevant data.
- **Evaluation metrics**: Common metrics include accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, especially for imbalanced datasets.

The most promising methodology for this work is the use of LLMs for targeted data augmentation, which addresses both data imbalance and the need for domain-specific text generation.

## 7. Conclusion

The literature review highlights the advancements in AI evaluation and reasoning tasks, particularly in the domain of financial sentiment analysis. While significant progress has been made with models like FinBERT, challenges such as data imbalance and overfitting remain prevalent. The review also emphasizes the potential of LLMs, such as GPT-5, to augment training data and improve model performance. This project aims to address these gaps by integrating LLM-generated synthetic data into the training process, enhancing the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
