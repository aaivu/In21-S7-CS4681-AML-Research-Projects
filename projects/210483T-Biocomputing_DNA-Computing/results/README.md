#  Experimental Results: Adapting Nucleotide Transformers for Genomic Disease Prediction

## Overview

This study evaluates **two parameter adaptation strategies** for the 500M-parameter Nucleotide Transformer model (NT-500M):

1. **LoRA Fine-Tuning** â€” Low-rank adaptation of attention layers  
2. **Linear Probing** â€” MLP classifier on top of frozen embeddings

We use a **variantâ€“disease reasoning dataset** derived from KEGG pathways with 37 disease classes.

| Linear Probing (MLP)               | Reference embeddings       | 88.89%   | 76.18%   | 78.22%    | 75.67% |
| **Linear Probing (MLP)**         | Variant + Reference concat | **91.78%** | **78.68%** | **80.33%** | **78.23%** |

 **Linear probing with concatenated embeddings outperformed LoRA fine-tuning in all metrics**, while being more computationally efficient.

##  Performance Insights

- LoRA fine-tuning provided competitive but lower accuracy compared to linear probing.  
- Concatenating variant and reference embeddings captures richer biological context.  
- Linear probing requires significantly less compute, making it ideal for scalable applications.
