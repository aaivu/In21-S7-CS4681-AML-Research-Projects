## Abstract

This research investigates the impact of intelligent example selection on one-shot learning performance for the LAMBADA dataset, a challenging benchmark requiring long-range dependency understanding for word prediction. While large language models demonstrate remarkable few-shot learning capabilities, the selection strategy for in-context examples remains largely unexplored. We propose a hybrid selection approach combining semantic similarity using sentence embeddings (20% weight) and syntactic compatibility through Part-of-Speech matching (80% weight). Our preliminary experiments with GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct demonstrate that strategic example selection significantly outperforms random selection, achieving 73.30% accuracy compared to 70.93% baseline and surpassing the originally reported GPT-3 one-shot performance of 72.5%. These findings reveal that syntactic structure is more critical than semantic content for word prediction tasks, and that a single strategically selected example can match the effectiveness of multiple randomly selected examples, with practical implications for prompt engineering and efficient LLM deployment.

## 1. Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their ability to perform tasks with minimal training examples—a capability known as in-context learning or few-shot learning. Brown et al.'s seminal work on GPT-3 demonstrated that scaling model parameters enables models to learn tasks from demonstrations provided in the prompt, without gradient updates or fine-tuning. This paradigm shift eliminates the need for task-specific training datasets and enables rapid adaptation across diverse tasks.

The LAMBADA (Language Modeling Broadened to Account for Discourse Aspects) dataset presents a particularly challenging test case for evaluating in-context learning. Unlike standard language modeling tasks, LAMBADA requires models to predict the final word of passages where accurate prediction necessitates understanding long-range dependencies and broad discourse context. The original GPT-3 paper reported an interesting anomaly: one-shot performance (72.5%) was actually lower than zero-shot performance (76.2%), counter to trends observed on most other tasks.

This observation motivates a fundamental question: does the selection strategy for demonstration examples matter? The original experiments used random selection, treating all examples as equally valuable. However, this approach ignores potentially important factors such as semantic similarity to the test case and syntactic compatibility of the target words. This research specifically focuses on one-shot learning to isolate the effect of example quality, minimize prompt length for practical efficiency, and address the performance anomaly observed in the original GPT-3 results.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite the widespread adoption of few-shot learning with large language models, the selection of in-context examples remains an under-explored area, particularly for one-shot learning scenarios. Current practices predominantly rely on random selection, which treats all examples as interchangeable. This approach fails to consider:

* **Semantic relevance:** How similar the demonstration context is to the test context in meaning and domain
* **Syntactic compatibility:** Whether the target word in the demonstration matches the grammatical role needed in the test case
* **Task-specific optimization:** What linguistic properties make examples effective for specific tasks like word prediction

The research problem can be formally stated as: **Given a test passage requiring word prediction and a pool of candidate demonstration examples, how can we systematically select the optimal single example to maximize one-shot learning performance on LAMBADA?**

This problem is significant because:
* One-shot learning represents the minimal information needed for in-context learning
* Strategic selection can reduce API costs and latency in real-world deployment
* Understanding example effectiveness provides theoretical insights into in-context learning mechanisms
* The LAMBADA one-shot performance anomaly suggests substantial optimization potential

## 3. Literature Review Summary

### Few-Shot and In-Context Learning
Brown et al. (2020) systematically demonstrated that large language models can perform tasks through in-context learning, with performance scaling with model size. Kaplan et al. (2020) showed that larger models exhibit steeper in-context learning curves. However, most research has focused on few-shot scenarios with multiple examples rather than optimizing single-example selection.

### Example Selection Strategies
Recent work by Min et al. (2022) investigated the role of ground-truth mappings versus format specification in few-shot learning. Liu et al. (2022) studied example ordering, demonstrating that performance varies significantly based on demonstration sequence. Rubin et al. (2022) proposed retrieval-based methods for semantic similarity selection in natural language inference tasks. However, systematic investigation of one-shot example selection combining semantic and syntactic factors remains limited.

### LAMBADA Dataset
Paperno et al. (2016) introduced LAMBADA to test discourse understanding and long-range dependency modeling. The dataset is specifically designed so that target words are guessable with full context but unpredictable from the final sentence alone. Early models struggled to exceed 60% accuracy, with GPT-2 achieving 63.2% through specialized prompting and GPT-3 reaching 76.2% zero-shot.

### Syntactic Information in Language Models
While language models implicitly learn syntactic categories (Newman et al., 2020), explicitly leveraging syntactic information for example selection in one-shot learning represents a novel contribution.

### Research Gap
No prior work has systematically investigated the relative importance of semantic versus syntactic compatibility for one-shot example selection on word prediction tasks. The anomalous one-shot performance on LAMBADA (lower than zero-shot) has not been addressed through intelligent example selection strategies.

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To develop and evaluate a hybrid example selection strategy combining semantic similarity and syntactic compatibility for optimizing one-shot learning performance on the LAMBADA dataset.

### Secondary Objectives
* Determine the optimal weighting between semantic similarity and Part-of-Speech matching for word prediction tasks.
* Quantify the performance improvement of strategic example selection over random baseline selection.
* Analyze the relative importance of syntactic versus semantic factors across different parts of speech.
* Investigate whether strategic one-shot selection can match or exceed the originally reported GPT-3 one-shot performance (72.5%).

## 5. Methodology

### 5.1 Dataset and Preprocessing
* **Dataset:** LAMBADA standard splits (5,153 test examples, 4,869 validation examples)
* **Candidate Pool:** Validation set filtered to remove multi-word targets and punctuation-heavy examples (resulting in 4,217 clean candidates)
* **Preprocessing:** Text lowercasing, whitespace normalization, POS tagging using `spaCy` (`en_core_web_sm`)

### 5.2 Hybrid Selection Strategy

**Semantic Similarity Component:**
* Use Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to encode test and candidate contexts.
* Compute cosine similarity between embeddings: $SemSim(C_{test}, C_{demo}) = \cos(e_{test}, e_{demo})$

**Syntactic Compatibility Component:**
* Extract Part-of-Speech tags for target words using `spaCy`.
* Binary matching: $SynSim = 1$ if $POS(w_{test}) = POS(w_{demo})$, else $0$.

**Hybrid Score:**
* Combined score: $Score = \alpha \cdot SemSim + (1 - \alpha) \cdot SynSim$
* Optimize $\alpha$ through grid search (test values: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0)
* Select demonstration: $C^*_{demo} = \text{argmax } Score(C_{test}, C_{demo})$

### 5.3 Prompt Engineering
Employ a cloze-style prompt format with clear instructions:

> Below are examples where you must predict the final missing word.
> Each passage ends with a blank (\_\_\_\_\_), and the correct word follows after '→'.
>
> Rules:
> - Output exactly ONE meaningful English word.
> - No punctuation or explanations.
>
> \[Context\_demo] \_\_\_\_\_ → \[Word\_demo]
>
> \[Context\_test] \_\_\_\_\_ →

### 5.4 Model and Hyperparameters
* **Model:** `GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct` (via OpenAI API)
* **Temperature:** 0.0 (deterministic generation)
* **Max tokens:** 3 (single-word predictions)
* **Top-p:** 1.0 (no nucleus sampling)

### 5.5 Evaluation Metrics
* **Primary:** Accuracy (exact match, case-insensitive)
* **Secondary:** Per-POS-category accuracy, error analysis
* **Baselines:** Random selection, zero-shot, published GPT-3 results

### 5.6 Experimental Design
1.  Implement semantic-only selection ($\alpha=1.0$)
2.  Implement POS-only selection ($\alpha=0.0$)
3.  Grid search for optimal $\alpha$
4.  Compare hybrid approach against random baseline
5.  Analyze performance across different POS categories
6.  Measure computational overhead and latency

## 6. Expected Outcomes

Based on preliminary experiments and theoretical foundations, we expect:

* **Performance Improvement:** Strategic example selection will achieve 2-3% accuracy improvement over random baseline (targeting >73% vs. ~71% baseline).
* **Syntactic Dominance:** Part-of-Speech matching will prove more important than semantic similarity for word prediction, with optimal $\alpha$ around 0.1-0.3 (favoring syntactic compatibility 70-90%).
* **Exceeding Published Results:** Our optimized one-shot approach will surpass the original GPT-3 one-shot performance of 72.5%.
* **Complementary Benefits:** The hybrid approach will outperform both pure semantic and pure syntactic strategies, demonstrating that both factors contribute to example effectiveness.
* **Practical Efficiency:** The selection overhead will remain minimal (<10% latency increase) while providing meaningful accuracy gains.
* **POS-Specific Patterns:** Different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives) will show varying sensitivity to semantic versus syntactic matching.
* **Replicable Framework:** A generalizable implementation that can be adapted to other one-shot learning tasks beyond LAMBADA.
