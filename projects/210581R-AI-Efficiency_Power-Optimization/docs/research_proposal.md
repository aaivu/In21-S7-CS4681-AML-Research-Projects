## Abstract

Recent advancements in Transformer-based architectures have significantly improved performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but at the cost of high computational and energy demands. The environmental impact of large-scale model training has brought attention to the need for Green AI—methods that optimize energy efficiency while preserving accuracy. This research focuses on fine-tuning DistilBERT, a compact version of BERT, to achieve improved accuracy-energy trade-offs through a combination of optimization techniques such as mixed precision training, gradient checkpointing, and optimizer tuning. Using the IMDB movie review dataset, the study will quantify both accuracy and carbon emissions to evaluate energy efficiency. The expected outcome is an optimized fine-tuning pipeline that significantly reduces carbon footprint and training time, providing practical insights into sustainable AI model development.

## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence models, especially large Transformer-based architectures, consume substantial computational power during training and fine-tuning. As model sizes and deployment scales increase, energy efficiency becomes a pressing concern. The Green AI movement emphasizes developing algorithms that deliver comparable accuracy at a reduced environmental cost. This research explores how lightweight architectures and optimization strategies can jointly contribute to sustainable model training. By using DistilBERT and fine-tuning it with efficiency-oriented techniques, the project aims to demonstrate that energy consumption can be minimized without compromising predictive performance.

## 2. Problem Statement

Transformer models such as BERT, despite their state-of-the-art performance, are computationally expensive and environmentally unsustainable. Fine-tuning these models on medium-sized datasets still results in substantial energy expenditure, contributing to higher carbon emissions.

The research problem can be stated as:

“How can we fine-tune Transformer-based NLP models in a more energy-efficient manner without sacrificing performance accuracy?”

## 3. Literature Review Summary

Recent studies have highlighted the carbon footprint of large-scale deep learning models (Strubell et al., 2019). Techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have shown promise in reducing training costs. DistilBERT, proposed by Sanh et al. (2019), compresses BERT by 40% while retaining 97% of its performance. Other works (Schwartz et al., 2020; Patterson et al., 2021) advocate for measuring and reporting energy consumption in ML research. However, limited research explores energy optimization during the fine-tuning phase, particularly for pre-trained models like DistilBERT.
This research aims to fill that gap by conducting a comparative evaluation of optimization strategies focused on reducing energy usage during fine-tuning.
