## Abstract

This literature review explores recent advances in reducing the computational and energy costs associated with large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models, focusing primarily on transformer-based architectures. As AI adoption grows, the energy footprint of training and fine-tuning deep models has become a key concern in Green AI research. This review synthesizes findings on energy-efficient training strategies, model compression, and optimization methods that aim to minimize resource consumption without compromising accuracy. Key trends highlight the emergence of lightweight transformer variants, efficient fine-tuning paradigms such as adapter-based learning, and novel hardware-aware optimization techniques.

## 1. Introduction

The exponential growth of deep learning models has led to remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and speech recognition. However, these gains come at a high computational and environmental cost, as training large transformer models like BERT and GPT requires substantial energy and carbon emissions. Green AI, an emerging paradigm, emphasizes improving AI performance per unit of energy rather than solely maximizing accuracy.

This review examines methods and frameworks aimed at improving the energy efficiency of transformer models, focusing on the fine-tuning process, where most real-world applications operate. The primary goal is to identify approaches that balance performance and sustainability — essential for the broader adoption of AI in resource-constrained environments.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Efficient Transformer Architectures

Recent studies introduced lightweight transformer variants such as DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019), ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020), and TinyBERT (Jiao et al., 2020) that achieve comparable accuracy to BERT while reducing parameters and computation by up to 60%. These models focus on architectural simplification, knowledge distillation, and parameter sharing.

**Key Papers:**
- [Sanh et al, 2019] - Introduced DistilBERT, reducing model size by 40% while retaining 97% of BERT’s performance.
- [Lan et al, 2020] - Proposed ALBERT, a parameter-sharing model with reduced memory footprint.
- [Jiao et al, 2020] - Developed TinyBERT using multi-stage knowledge distillation.

### 3.2 Energy-Aware Training and Optimization

Techniques like gradient checkpointing, mixed-precision training, and efficient learning rate schedulers reduce energy usage during training and fine-tuning. The use of 16-bit floating-point precision (FP16) and gradient recomputation are particularly effective in lowering GPU power consumption.

**Key Papers:**
- [Micikevicius et al, 2018] - Introduced mixed-precision training with FP16 arithmetic for faster, lower-energy computation.
- [Chen et al, 2016] - Proposed gradient checkpointing to trade compute for memory efficiency.
- [Henderson et al, 2020] - Quantified the energy savings from adaptive learning rate schedulers.

### 3.3 Model Compression and Quantization

Compression methods such as weight pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation aim to shrink model size while maintaining performance. These techniques are essential for deploying models on edge devices with limited resources.

**Key Papers:**
- [Han et al, 2016] - Introduced deep compression through pruning and quantization.
- [Jacob et al, 2018] - Developed quantization-aware training for TensorFlow models.
- [Hinton et al, 2015] - Proposed knowledge distillation for model compression.

### 3.4 Carbon Footprint Measurement and Reporting

Frameworks like CodeCarbon, ML CO2 Impact, and Experiment Impact Tracker provide tools to estimate and track the environmental impact of model training, encouraging transparency and sustainability in AI research.

**Key Papers:**
- [Lacoste et al, 2018] - IDeveloped CodeCarbon to monitor CO₂ emissions of ML experiments.
- [Patterson et al, 2016] - Quantified the carbon intensity of training large language models like GPT-3.



## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities


### Gap 1: Lack of energy-performance trade-off benchmarks

**Why it matters:** 
Current literature focuses heavily on accuracy metrics while neglecting standardized energy efficiency comparisons.
**How your project addresses it:** 
This research provides comparative analysis of optimizers (Adam, AdamW, SGD) on both accuracy and energy metrics using CodeCarbon.

### Gap 2: Limited studies on fine-tuning efficiency rather than pre-training

**Why it matters:** 
Fine-tuning is where most industrial and academic models are optimized for specific tasks, yet most studies emphasize pre-training cost.

**How your project addresses it:** 
By analyzing fine-tuning strategies on IMDB sentiment classification, this project targets energy optimization in the most practical stage of model use.

### Gap 3: Lack of reproducible frameworks for Green AI

**Why it matters:** 
Many works lack public implementations, making it difficult to validate energy savings.

**How your project addresses it:** 
The research includes a reproducible Colab notebook implementing all optimization techniques with transparent tracking of CO₂ metrics.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

The study builds upon the Green AI framework (Schwartz et al., 2020), emphasizing performance-per-energy as a key metric. It also leverages the Efficient Deep Learning paradigm, which integrates computational optimization with environmental sustainability principles.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Most studies adopt empirical experimentation with standard NLP benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, GLUE) and energy-tracking tools. Transformer fine-tuning typically involves libraries like HuggingFace Transformers and frameworks like PyTorch. Among the optimization methods, mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing consistently deliver high energy savings with minimal performance loss.

## 7. Conclusion

The reviewed literature underscores a growing emphasis on sustainable AI. Lightweight architectures, efficient fine-tuning, and energy tracking have become vital for reducing environmental impact. However, standardized reporting and cross-model comparisons remain underexplored. This project contributes to filling this gap by systematically evaluating fine-tuning optimizations for DistilBERT in terms of both accuracy and energy efficiency.
