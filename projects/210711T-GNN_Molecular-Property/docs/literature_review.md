## Abstract

This literature review explores recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecular property prediction, focusing on architectures such as Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), 3D geometric encoders like SchNet, and multi-view pretraining approaches such as GraphMVP. Benchmark datasets like MoleculeNet have standardized evaluation across diverse chemical domains, emphasizing scaffold-based splits to assess generalization. While state-of-the-art models leverage 2D–3D representation learning, this review identifies gaps in fine-tuning efficiency and imbalance handling for specific biochemical prediction tasks like HIV inhibition. Our project builds on these findings by developing a lightweight fine-tuning strategy that improves robustness and performance without pretraining.

## 1. Introduction

Predicting molecular properties is a cornerstone of computational chemistry and drug discovery. Traditional models relied on handcrafted descriptors, but graph neural networks (GNNs) now learn directly from molecular structures by representing atoms and bonds as graph nodes and edges. This paradigm enables generalization across chemical tasks and compounds. The MoleculeNet benchmark has driven this research forward, providing standardized datasets and scaffold-based splits to test true generalization beyond seen chemotypes. However, molecular datasets such as HIV inhibition remain heavily imbalanced, challenging optimization and evaluation. Our review and project focus on improving fine-tuning under such imbalance using GNNs.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 MoleculeNet and Benchmarking

Wu et al. (2018) introduced MoleculeNet, establishing standardized datasets, metrics, and scaffold splits for molecular property prediction. This benchmark has become central for evaluating model generalization across chemotypes.

**Key Papers:**

- Wu et al., Chemical Science, 2018 — Introduced MoleculeNet with 17 datasets, including HIV inhibition and quantum chemistry tasks.
- Morris et al., NeurIPS, 2019 — Analyzed benchmark stability and generalization in GNN models.

### 3.2 Graph Neural Network Architectures

Xu et al. (2019) proposed the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), theoretically equivalent in expressive power to the Weisfeiler–Lehman test. Its simplicity and strength made it the standard 2D encoder in MoleculeNet.

### 3.3 3D Molecular Encoders

Xu et al. (2019) proposed the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), theoretically equivalent in expressive power to the Weisfeiler–Lehman test. Its simplicity and strength made it the standard 2D encoder in MoleculeNet.

### 3.4 Multi-View Pretraining (GraphMVP)

Hou et al. (2022) proposed GraphMVP, aligning 2D and 3D molecular representations through contrastive and generative objectives. It improved MoleculeNet downstream tasks, showing the benefit of multi-view alignment.

### 3.5 Imbalance-Aware Learning

Focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) and class-balanced sampling address skewed datasets, improving minority-class recall. These methods are simple yet powerful when integrated into fine-tuning pipelines.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

[Identify gaps in current research that your project could address]

### Gap 1: Limited Exploration of Imbalance-Aware Fine-Tuning

**Why it matters:** Most works focus on pretraining rather than improving fine-tuning for skewed biochemical datasets.
**How your project addresses it:** We introduce focal loss, balanced sampling, and adaptive scheduling to improve downstream performance without pretraining.

### Gap 2: High Computational Cost of Pretraining

**Why it matters:** Multi-view pretraining requires massive 3D datasets (e.g., GEOM, >40GB) and long training times.
**How your project addresses it:** Our lightweight fine-tuning strategy offers competitive gains using standard resources.

### Gap 3: Evaluation Metrics Misalignment

**Why it matters:** ROC-AUC alone can misrepresent success in rare-positive settings.
**How your project addresses it:** We report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1, aligning evaluation with practical screening requirements.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

This study builds upon message-passing neural network theory, where atomic embeddings are iteratively updated based on neighboring node features and bond types. The Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) serves as the core theoretical model, providing maximum expressive power among standard GNNs.

## 6. Methodology Insights

The most effective GNN pipelines combine:

- A 2D structural encoder (GIN) for topological learning.
- Imbalance handling via focal loss and balanced sampling.
- Training optimizations such as mixed precision (AMP), learning-rate scheduling, and early stopping.
- Our project implements these insights to improve fine-tuning stability and generalization on the MoleculeNet HIV dataset.

## 7. Conclusion

The literature reveals two major trends: (1) representation learning via large-scale pretraining (GraphMVP, SchNet), and (2) task-specific optimization improvements for limited-resource scenarios. This project contributes to the second direction—showing that even without pretraining, careful imbalance-aware fine-tuning of GIN achieves improved ROC-AUC and stability. The resulting workflow forms a robust baseline for future integration with 3D-aware encoders.
