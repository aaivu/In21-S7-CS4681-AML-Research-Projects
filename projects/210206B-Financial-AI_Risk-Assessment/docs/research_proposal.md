## Abstract

This research investigates optimization strategies for training Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE) efficiently on mid-range hardware. NODE has demonstrated strong performance on tabular data but often demands high computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning. This study aims to improve training stability, reduce hardware dependence, and enhance generalization through techniques such as cosine learning rate scheduling, label smoothing, focal loss, and mixed-precision training (AMP). The proposed approach will be evaluated on diverse tabular datasets and benchmarked against leading models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Expected outcomes include a reproducible lightweight training pipeline for NODE that democratizes deep learning research on tabular data, particularly for resource-limited institutions.

## 1. Introduction

Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing but often underperform on tabular datasets. Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE) offer a deep-learning-based approach for tabular learning but require significant computational resources and are sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. This work focuses on optimizing NODE’s training process to make it practical for researchers and organizations operating with limited GPU resources.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite its strong representational power, NODE faces instability during optimization, particularly under constrained hardware environments. Training requires extensive hyperparameter tuning, leading to long experimentation cycles and poor reproducibility. The research problem addressed in this work is:  
**“How can NODE be efficiently trained on resource-limited hardware without sacrificing stability or accuracy?”**

## 3. Literature Review Summary

Recent works in tabular learning have proposed several models:
- **XGBoost** (Chen & Guestrin, 2016) and **LightGBM** (Ke et al., 2017) remain dominant due to their robustness and efficiency.  
- **CatBoost** (Dorogush et al., 2018) improved handling of categorical data.  
- **TabNet** (Arik & Pfister, 2021) introduced attention-based feature selection.  
- **FT-Transformer** (Gorishniy et al., 2021) applied transformer architectures to structured data.

While NODE provides interpretability and competitive performance, prior research lacks a systematic study on training efficiency and optimization under constrained computational environments.
