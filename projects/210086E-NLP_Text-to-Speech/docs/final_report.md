# Accelerating Neural Text-to-Speech via Frequency-Domain Vocoding: Final Report

## Executive Summary

This research addresses a critical bottleneck in modern neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems by proposing an inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (iSTFT)-based vocoder architecture. Through comprehensive profiling and architectural innovation, we achieved real-time synthesis capability (RTF=0.22) with an 82% parameter reduction compared to the industry-standard HiFi-GAN vocoder, while maintaining acceptable perceptual quality on the diverse VCTK multi-speaker dataset.

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern neural TTS systems, particularly VITS, achieve near-human speech quality but face significant computational bottlenecks that prevent deployment on resource-constrained devices and latency-sensitive applications. Our profiling analysis identified that the HiFi-GAN vocoder component accounts for **40-60% of total inference time**, primarily due to expensive transposed convolution operations used for waveform upsampling.

### Key Bottleneck Identified
- **Text Encoder (Transformer)**: 15-20% of inference time
- **Flow-based Modules**: 15-25% of inference time
- **HiFi-GAN Vocoder**: 40-60% of inference time (PRIMARY TARGET)
- **Other Components**: <10% of inference time

## 3. Proposed Solution: iSTFT Vocoder Architecture

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

The iSTFT vocoder consists of four main components:

**Component 1: Feature Projection**
- Maps 80-dimensional mel-spectrograms to 256-dimensional hidden representations
- Uses 1D convolution (kernel size 7) with LayerNorm and GELU activation

**Component 2: Residual Convolution Stack**
- Six residual blocks with dilated convolutions
- Dilation pattern: [1, 3, 9, 27, 1, 3]
- Receptive field: ~81 frames for capturing temporal dependencies

**Component 3: Dual Spectrum Prediction Heads**
- **Magnitude Head**: Predicts amplitude spectrum (513 bins for n_fft=1024) with Softplus activation
- **Phase Head**: Predicts phase spectrum (513 bins) with Tanh activation scaled to [-π, π]

**Component 4: Complex Spectrum Formation and iSTFT**
- Combines magnitude and phase: S = |S| · e^(j∠S)
- Applies inverse STFT using PyTorch's optimized torch.istft()
- Parameters: n_fft=1024, hop_length=256, window=Hann

### 3.2 Key Innovation: Eliminating Transposed Convolutions

Traditional HiFi-GAN employs three upsampling stages (8×, 8×, 2× for total 128× upsampling) with increasingly large feature maps. Our iSTFT approach eliminates this entirely by predicting frequency-domain representations directly, resulting in:
- Direct synthesis without intermediate upsampling
- Computational cost reduction from O(n²) to O(n log n) via FFT
- 82% parameter reduction (2.5M vs. 13.9M parameters)

## 4. Experimental Methodology

### 4.1 Dataset and Preprocessing

- **Source**: VCTK Corpus (multi-speaker, multi-accent English dataset)
- **Audio Processing**: Downsample to 22.05kHz, normalize to [-1, 1], apply pre-emphasis (α=0.97)
- **Feature Extraction**: 80-dimensional mel-spectrograms (STFT: window=1024, hop=256, Hann window)
- **Segmentation**: Fixed-length segments (16,000 samples ≈ 0.73s)
- **Data Split**: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% test (speaker-based split for robust generalization)

### 4.2 Training Strategy

**Multi-Objective Loss Function**:
```
L_total = λ_time · L_time + λ_mel · L_mel + λ_stft · L_stft
```

Where:
- **L_time**: L1 distance in time-domain (waveform matching)
- **L_mel**: L1 distance in mel-spectrogram space (perceptual quality)

- **Loss Weights**: λ_time=1.0, λ_mel=45.0, λ_stft=1.0 (high mel-weight prioritizes perceptual quality)

**Training Configuration**:
- Optimizer: AdamW (β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999, weight_decay=10⁻⁶)
- Learning Rate: 2×10⁻⁴ with exponential decay (γ=0.999 per epoch)
- Batch Size: 32 samples per GPU
- Gradient Clipping: Maximum norm 1.0
- Duration: 100 epochs (~250,000 steps) with early stopping (patience=10)
- Hardware: NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU (8GB VRAM)

### 4.3 Evaluation Metrics

**Quality Metrics**:
- Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD): Perceptual spectral similarity; <6 dB considered high quality
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): Overall reconstruction fidelity; >15 dB acceptable

**Efficiency Metrics**:
- Real-Time Factor (RTF): Synthesis time to audio duration ratio; <1.0 indicates real-time capability

## 7. Identified Limitations and Issues

### Quality Considerations

- **High-Frequency Attenuation**: Slight muffling in consonants and sibilants due to mel-scale loss weighting
- **Phase Artifacts**: Occasional distortions from imperfect phase prediction, particularly during transients
- **Quality Gap**: 1.4 dB MCD higher than HiFi-GAN (5.21 vs. 3.8 dB)

### Architectural Insights

- Phase prediction remains inherently challenging; magnitude prediction is significantly more accurate
- L1 loss and convolutional processing tend to smooth fine temporal details
- Mel-weighted losses naturally prioritize low frequencies over high frequencies

### Perceptual Quality Analysis

- **Intelligibility**: Speech content clearly understandable across all test samples
- **Speaker Identity**: Speaker characteristics well preserved in multi-speaker setting
- **Naturalness**: Overall perceptual quality rated as "good" (~90% similarity to ground truth)
- **Artifacts**: Identified muffling in high frequencies and occasional phase-related distortions

| **Use Case** | High-quality synthesis | Resource-constrained deployment |

This represents a favorable efficiency-quality trade-off for applications prioritizing speed and resource efficiency over marginal quality improvements.

## 10. Conclusion

This research successfully demonstrates that frequency-domain vocoding is a viable path toward practical deployment of neural TTS systems on resource-constrained devices. By identifying the HiFi-GAN vocoder as the primary computational bottleneck and developing an iSTFT-based architecture that eliminates expensive transposed convolutions:

- Achieved **real-time synthesis** (RTF=0.22) on GPU with **4-5× speedup** over HiFi-GAN
- Reduced parameters by **82%** (2.5M vs. 13.9M parameters)
- Maintained **acceptable perceptual quality** (MCD 5.21 dB, SNR 18.9 dB)
- Demonstrated **robust multi-speaker generalization** on 109 speakers
- Created **edge-device compatible** system with <50 MB total footprint

While exhibiting slight quality degradation (1.4 dB MCD difference) compared to HiFi-GAN, this represents an optimal efficiency-quality trade-off for resource-constrained deployment scenarios. The work provides practical evidence that architectural design choices, rather than solely relying on model compression techniques, can effectively enable real-time neural TTS synthesis for practical applications including on-device speech synthesis, real-time voice assistants, and low-latency communication systems.
