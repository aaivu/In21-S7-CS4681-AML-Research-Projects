## Abstract

This literature review explores the adaptation of large multimodal foundation models, particularly Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), to downstream tasks under few-shot learning conditions. We examine how pre-trained models can be efficiently fine-tuned or adapted to perform well with minimal labeled data, focusing on strategies such as hybrid prototype methods, linear probing, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Key findings highlight that parameter-efficient techniques significantly reduce computational costs and overfitting risks while maintaining or improving accuracy. Hybrid approaches that combine visual and textual priors prove especially powerful in ultra-low-shot scenarios, while fine-tuning methods offer scalability as data availability increases.

## 1. Introduction

The rise of large-scale multimodal foundation models has revolutionized vision-and-language tasks by enabling robust zero-shot transfer. Models like CLIP, ALIGN, and CoCa learn joint representations of images and text, facilitating versatile downstream applications such as classification, captioning, and retrieval. However, their performance in few-shot learning (FSL) scenarios—where only a handful of labeled examples are available—remains a key challenge.

Full fine-tuning of these models is often computationally prohibitive and risks overfitting. This motivates research into parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques and alternative adaptation methods that exploit the rich pre-trained representations without extensive retraining. This literature review surveys the landscape of few-shot adaptation strategies for multimodal models, with a focus on CoCa, and discusses how they enable efficient transfer learning in data-scarce conditions.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Multimodal foundational models
Large-scale pre-trained models have become central to multimodal AI. CLIP [1] and ALIGN [2] learn joint visual-text representations through contrastive objectives, enabling strong zero-shot capabilities. CoCa [3] builds on these advances by combining contrastive and generative training paradigms, allowing both discriminative classification and generative tasks like captioning.

- Jia et al., 2021 – ALIGN: Demonstrated large-scale multimodal learning with noisy supervision.
- Yu et al., 2022 – CoCa: Proposed a dual-objective pre-training framework with contrastive and captioning capabilities.

### 3.2 Few-Shot Learning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
Few-shot learning focuses on transferring knowledge from pre-trained models to new tasks with minimal labeled data. Traditional approaches include meta-learning [5] and metric learning [6]. However, recent research emphasizes adapting pre-trained models directly using PEFT methods. LoRA [4], for example, introduces low-rank weight updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters. Adapter modules [7] and prompt tuning [8] are other notable techniques.

**Key Papers:**
- Hu et al., 2021 – LoRA: Introduced low-rank adaptation for large models with minimal parameter overhead..
- Houlsby et al., 2019 – Proposed adapter modules for efficient model transfer.
- Lester et al., 2021 – Demonstrated prompt tuning for scalable adaptation.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

### Gap 1: Underexplored PEFT for Multimodal Models
**Why it matters:** Most PEFT research targets language models, with limited exploration in multimodal architectures like CoCa.
**How your project addresses it:** This study evaluates linear probing and LoRA for adapting CoCa in few-shot image classification tasks.

### Gap 2: Limited Use of Semantic Priors in Few-Shot Settings
**Why it matters:** Traditional few-shot methods rely mainly on visual data, ignoring rich textual knowledge from pre-training.
**How your project addresses it:** The hybrid prototype approach leverages textual embeddings to enhance performance, particularly in ultra-low-shot regimes.
## 5. Theoretical Framework

This research builds on theories of transfer learning and representation learning, which posit that features learned from large, diverse datasets can be effectively repurposed for new tasks. It also draws on metric learning principles for prototype-based classification, and low-rank matrix factorization in LoRA for efficient parameter updates. Together, these frameworks underpin the strategies used for adapting CoCa to few-shot learning tasks.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Common methodologies in few-shot adaptation include:
Prototype-based classification: Leverages averaged embeddings for classification without training, ideal for ultra-low-shot tasks.
Linear probing: Adds a trainable classification head while freezing the backbone, balancing performance and efficiency.
LoRA fine-tuning: Injects low-rank trainable matrices into transformer layers for deeper adaptation with minimal parameter growth.
Among these, prototype methods excel with extremely limited data, while LoRA provides scalable improvements as more samples become available.

## 7. Conclusion

Recent advances in few-shot learning and PEFT have significantly improved the adaptability of multimodal foundation models like CoCa. Hybrid prototype methods offer a simple yet powerful approach to leverage semantic priors in data-scarce settings. Linear probing enhances performance with minimal computational overhead, and LoRA presents a promising avenue for deeper, efficient adaptation. These insights guide future work toward more robust, flexible, and resource-efficient few-shot adaptation strategies.
