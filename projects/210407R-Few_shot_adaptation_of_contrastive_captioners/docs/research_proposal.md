## Abstract

Large-scale multimodal models like Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), pretrained on web-scale datasets, demonstrate remarkable zero-shot capabilities but face challenges in adapting to downstream tasks with sparse labeled data. This research presents a comprehensive empirical study on few-shot adaptation of CoCa for image classification, systematically evaluating a hierarchy of adaptation methods from parameter-free hybrid prototyping to parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA. Using the Mini-ImageNet benchmark, we evaluate methods across varying data regimes (1-20 shots). Key findings indicate that hybrid prototype approaches effectively utilize CoCa's multimodality with strong performance in very low-shot scenarios, while LoRA fine-tuning with metric-based losses (Prototypical and Supervised Contrastive) outperforms cross-entropy in extremely low-shot settings (1-5 shots), demonstrating better generalization from scarce data. However, cross-entropy loss becomes more competitive as shots increase, revealing important data-dependent trade-offs in loss function selection for few-shot learning.

## 1. Introduction

The emergence of large-scale foundation models pretrained on diverse, web-scale datasets has fundamentally transformed deep learning. Vision-and-language models such as CLIP and ALIGN have established new benchmarks for zero-shot transfer learning by aligning images and text in shared embedding spaces through contrastive learning. Contrastive Captioners (CoCa) advances this paradigm by combining contrastive and generative pre-training objectives into a unified architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse multimodal tasks.

Despite their powerful zero-shot capabilities, effectively adapting these large multimodal models to specific downstream tasks with limited labeled data—a setting known as few-shot learning—remains non-trivial. Full fine-tuning of foundation models is often computationally infeasible, data-inefficient, and risks catastrophic forgetting of valuable pre-trained knowledge. Recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have emerged as viable alternatives, updating only a small fraction of model parameters. While PEFT has been extensively studied for large language models, its application to complex multimodal architectures like CoCa remains largely unexplored. This research addresses this gap by systematically investigating how to best adapt CoCa for few-shot learning scenarios.

## 2. Problem Statement

The primary challenge addressed by this research is: **How can large-scale multimodal foundation models like CoCa be efficiently adapted to image classification tasks in few-shot learning scenarios, balancing performance, computational efficiency, and the risk of overfitting?**

Specific sub-problems include:

1. **Multimodal Knowledge Utilization:** How can we effectively leverage CoCa's dual capacity for both visual and textual understanding in few-shot settings where labeled visual data is extremely limited?

2. **Computational Efficiency:** What is the minimal set of trainable parameters required to achieve competitive performance without full model fine-tuning?

3. **Data-Dependent Trade-offs:** How do different adaptation strategies and loss functions perform across varying data regimes, and how should practitioners select appropriate methods based on available data?

4. **Overfitting Prevention:** How can regularization and augmentation strategies mitigate overfitting when training data is scarce?

## 3. Literature Review Summary

### Key Related Work

**Multimodal Foundation Models:** Vision-and-language models have evolved through three main pre-training paradigms. Single-encoder models learn strong visual representations but lack linguistic understanding. Dual-encoder models (CLIP, ALIGN) use contrastive learning to align images and text, enabling powerful zero-shot retrieval. Encoder-decoder models use generative objectives for tasks requiring fused reasoning. CoCa uniquely combines these approaches with both contrastive and generative pre-training, providing strong aligned representations and generative capability.

**Few-Shot Learning:** Classic approaches include meta-learning and metric-learning, which learn to learn from limited examples. With the rise of large pre-trained models, the paradigm has shifted toward adapting these models' rich, general-purpose features to specific tasks, reducing the need for specialized meta-learning algorithms.

**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning:** PEFT methods like Adapter Modules, Prompt Tuning, and LoRA enable efficient model adaptation while modifying only a small percentage of parameters. LoRA, in particular, has gained significant traction for its performance-efficiency balance, injecting trainable low-rank matrices into transformer layers to approximate weight updates.

### Research Gap

While PEFT techniques have been extensively studied in NLP and increasingly in vision tasks, their application to visio-linguistic models like CoCa for few-shot learning remains underinvestigated. No comprehensive empirical study systematically compares simple prototype-based approaches with parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies across varying data regimes for multimodal foundation models.

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective

To systematically evaluate and compare multiple adaptation strategies for CoCa in few-shot image classification, determining which methods are most effective across different data regimes and identifying optimal practices for adapting multimodal foundation models to data-scarce scenarios.

### Secondary Objectives

- Quantify the effectiveness of parameter-free hybrid prototype approaches that leverage CoCa's multimodal nature without any training
- Evaluate linear probing with frozen encoders as a simple yet effective baseline requiring minimal additional parameters
- Analyze the performance of LoRA fine-tuning with various loss functions and configurations across different shot settings
- Identify data-dependent trade-offs between metric-based losses (Prototypical, Supervised Contrastive) and cross-entropy loss
- Provide practical guidelines for practitioners on method selection based on computational constraints and data availability
- Demonstrate that adaptive LoRA configurations (rank and target modules scaled by available data) improve few-shot adaptation

## 5. Methodology

This research employs a comparative empirical methodology evaluating three adaptation strategies in a hierarchy of increasing complexity and parametric cost:

**Strategy 1: Parameter-Free Hybrid Prototype Method** combines visual and textual embeddings without training. Visual prototypes are computed as normalized means of image embeddings for each class, while textual prototypes use prompt ensembling. A weighted combination with hyperparameter α produces hybrid prototypes for classification via cosine similarity.

**Strategy 2: Linear Probing** attaches a trainable linear classification head to the frozen CoCa visual encoder. Strong data augmentation (random resized crop, horizontal flip, color jitter, random grayscale) addresses data scarcity. Training uses AdamW optimizer, cross-entropy loss with label smoothing, and cosine learning rate scheduling.

**Strategy 3: LoRA Fine-Tuning** applies low-rank decomposition to update weights: $h = W_0 x + BAx$, where only matrices A and B are trained. An adaptive configuration scales rank (4, 8, or 16) and target modules based on available shots. Three loss functions are investigated: cross-entropy, Prototypical loss, and Supervised Contrastive loss.

**Experimental Setup:** Using Mini-ImageNet (100 classes, 600 images each), we construct balanced few-shot splits with 2,000 images each for training, validation, and testing. Experiments evaluate performance across shot settings N ∈ {1, 3, 5, 10, 20}. Each experiment is repeated 3 times with different random seeds, reporting mean accuracy.
