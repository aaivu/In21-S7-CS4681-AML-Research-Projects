## Abstract

This literature review explores recent advancements in deep learning–based speech separation and enhancement, focusing on transformer architectures and lightweight post-processing approaches. The review examines conventional and modern models such as Conv-TasNet, DPRNN, and SepFormer, and identifies limitations in residual artifacts and computational complexity. A gap is recognized in developing lightweight, modular post-processing methods that enhance separated speech without retraining. This study motivates the use of a two-stage architecture—SepFormer for separation and a lightweight CNN denoiser for artifact removal—to improve perceptual speech quality with minimal computational overhead.

## 1. Introduction

Speech separation aims to extract individual speech sources from mixed audio, addressing challenges in telecommunication, hearing aids, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Deep learning has enabled significant progress, with convolutional, recurrent, and transformer-based networks achieving state-of-the-art results. However, separated signals from even advanced systems such as SepFormer often retain residual noise and artifacts that reduce perceptual quality. This review surveys existing research in speech separation, denoising, and post-processing to identify methods and research gaps that inform the development of an efficient denoising module for separated speech.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Speech Separation Techniques

Early research relied on statistical and signal processing methods such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA), but these struggled in noisy, real-world conditions. Deep learning introduced methods like Deep Clustering (DPCL) [Hershey et al., 2016] and Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) [Yu et al., 2017], which resolved label ambiguity issues.  
Time-domain models such as Conv-TasNet [Luo & Mesgarani, 2019] and Dual-Path RNN (DPRNN) [Luo et al., 2020] provided low-latency, high-quality separation by directly operating on waveforms.

### 3.2 Transformer-Based Speech Separation

Transformers, first applied to NLP tasks [Vaswani et al., 2017], later transformed speech separation research. SepFormer [Subakan et al., 2021] introduced a dual-path transformer that models both local and global dependencies, outperforming CNN and RNN models. Variants like Dual-Path Transformer Network (DPTNet) [Chen et al., 2020] and other cross-attention architectures further improved separation accuracy.

### 3.3 Speech Enhancement and Denoising

Speech enhancement research targets artifact and noise removal from separated or noisy speech. Early methods like Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction [Ephraim & Malah, 1984] laid the foundation. Deep learning methods such as Denoising Autoencoders (DAE), GAN-based enhancement (SEGAN), and WaveNet denoisers significantly improved perceptual quality.

- Lu et al. (2013) – Deep denoising autoencoder for speech enhancement.  
- Rethage et al. (2018) – WaveNet for speech denoising.

### 3.4 Post-Processing for Speech Separation

Most studies enhance separation quality by redesigning main architectures, but few target post-separation refinement. Recent work explores multi-stage pipelines, perceptual loss functions, and lightweight enhancement networks to suppress residual artifacts.

- Zhang et al. (2020) – Multi-stage speech separation with iterative refinement.  
- Kolbæk et al. (2020) – Perceptual loss functions for separation optimization.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

### Gap 1: Limited post-processing methods for separated speech  
**Why it matters:** Current models focus on improving separation but neglect post-processing for quality refinement.  
**How your project addresses it:** Proposes a lightweight CNN denoiser that refines SepFormer outputs without retraining.

### Gap 2: High computational cost of advanced separation networks  
**Why it matters:** Transformer-based models are resource-intensive, limiting real-time deployment.  
**How your project addresses it:** Introduces a 305-parameter denoiser that adds minimal computational overhead.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

The theoretical foundation combines deep learning–based speech separation (using SepFormer’s dual-path transformer) and convolutional post-processing. The system aligns with the multi-stage auditory processing paradigm, where initial separation models global structure and the secondary CNN refines local spectral artifacts. This framework balances performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Common methodologies include:
- **Data:** WSJ0-2mix benchmark for two-speaker separation.  
- **Metrics:** SI-SDR, PESQ, and STOI for evaluating separation and perceptual quality.  
- **Approaches:** Transformer-based architectures for separation, convolutional models for denoising.  
The reviewed literature indicates that combining these techniques in modular two-stage systems yields measurable quality gains without increasing complexity.

## 7. Conclusion

Recent research demonstrates major progress in speech separation through transformer networks, yet challenges persist in residual noise and computational efficiency. Literature shows limited exploration of modular post-processing. This gap motivates integrating a lightweight CNN denoiser with SepFormer to enhance perceptual quality. The proposed framework leverages efficiency, adaptability, and real-time feasibility—key factors for practical NLP:ionSpeech enhancement systems.
