# Research Proposal: AI Efficiency:Embedding Normalization
**Student:** 210207E 
**Research Area:** AI Efficiency:Dataset Efficiency 

## Abstract

This project proposes a rigorous ablation study to evaluate **Embedding Normalization** (LayerNorm or RMSNorm) within the GPT-style Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While large-scale studies caution against this technique due to performance regression, its effect at smaller, controlled scales remains unverified. Using a custom 1.6 million parameter model trained on the Shakespeare dataset for a fixed 300 iterations, we will measure the impact of post-embedding normalization on core metrics: Validation Perplexity (PPL) and training stability (Total Gradient Norm). The goal is to conclusively characterize the stability-accuracy trade-off, providing data-driven guidance on whether embedding normalization should be reserved exclusively for stabilizing unstable training runs, even at non-billion-parameter scales.

## 1. Introduction

The Pre-LayerNorm Transformer, essential for scaling LLMs like GPT-3, provides high training stability. However, the initial feature representation—the sum of token and positional embeddings—is a subtle area prone to optimization. This research focuses on the targeted architectural enhancement of inserting a single normalization layer (LN or RMS) directly after this combined embedding. This addresses a critical, yet unverified, point of instability at the very start of the network, with the potential to improve early learning dynamics or, conversely, constrain representational power.

## 2. Problem Statement

The established best practice, based on large-scale LLM studies, is to **avoid embedding normalization** by default due to a observed reduction in zero-shot generalization accuracy. However, due to the non-transferability of micro-architectural findings across different scales and implementations, it is unknown whether this finding holds true for a resource-constrained, **stable, small-scale GPT-style model** (1.6M parameters). The research problem is to quantitatively test this assumption and definitively characterize the **stability-accuracy trade-off** in this specific, common architectural context.

## 3. Literature Review Summary

The literature provides strong, yet indirect, evidence that embedding normalization is detrimental at large scales (Le Scao et al. [1]). Studies on LayerNorm vs. RMSNorm have focused mostly on application *inside* Transformer blocks (BLOOM [2], Teuken7B [4]), leaving a clear gap on their comparative effect at the embedding layer. Methodological rigor is guided by industry best practices (Chinchilla [7], Gopher [6]) which mandate fixed compute budgets and multi-seed validation, justifying the need for this custom-scale study (Narang et al. [5]).

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To conclusively determine and characterize the **stability-accuracy trade-off** resulting from the introduction of LayerNorm or RMSNorm post-embedding normalization in a 1.6M parameter, Pre-LN GPT-style Transformer.

### Secondary Objectives
1.  **Quantitative Assessment:** Measure the difference in mean Validation Perplexity (PPL) between the normalized variants and the un-normalized Baseline over 300 iterations across five seeds.
2.  **Stability Analysis:** Quantify the stability benefit by comparing the **Final Total Gradient Norm** of the normalized variants against the Baseline.
3.  **Best Practice Guidance:** Formulate actionable recommendations on the default use of embedding normalization for GPT-style architectures at small scales.

## 5. Methodology

The approach is a comparative ablation study:
*   **Model:** Custom 1.6M parameter GPT-style model (8 layers, 128 dim, Pre-LN).
*   **Variants:** Baseline (None), LayerNorm, and RMSNorm applied post-token+positional embedding.
*   **Dataset:** Character-level Shakespeare (1.1M characters).
*   **Controls:** Fixed 300-iteration training budget, identical hyperparameters, and validation across five random seeds.
*   **Metrics:** Validation Perplexity (PPL, $\downarrow$), Final Total Gradient Norm ($\downarrow$), and Mean Embedding Norm (Diagnostic).

## 6. Expected Outcomes

The project is expected to yield one of two outcomes, either of which constitutes a significant contribution:

1.  **Validation of Caution (Most Likely):** The normalization layers will significantly improve stability (lower Grad Norm) but cause a statistically significant regression in PPL compared to the Baseline, thus validating the stability-accuracy trade-off and reinforcing the caution against this technique.
2.  **Conditional Benefit (Less Likely):** One of the normalized variants (likely LN) will show a measurable PPL gain without catastrophic instability, providing the first robust evidence for embedding normalization's utility at this scale.

The final contribution will be a conference-ready paper with definitive, statistically robust empirical evidence for a specific architectural context.
