## Abstract

This literature review explores recent advancements in question answering systems, focusing on unified architectures and multi-hop reasoning capabilities. While UNIFIEDQA demonstrated that diverse QA formats can be bridged in single-hop settings, multi-hop reasoning introduces additional challenges requiring integration of evidence across multiple passages. This review examines benchmark datasets like HotpotQA, methodological approaches including decomposition and graph-based reasoning, and unified frameworks. Our project builds on these findings by developing UNIFIEDQA-MH, an extension fine-tuned specifically for multi-hop domains that maintains strong generalization across single-hop QA formats.

## 1. Introduction

Question answering has long been a central benchmark for evaluating machine understanding of natural language, with tasks spanning diverse formats including extractive span selection, multiple-choice, and generative answering. While significant progress has been achieved in single-hop QA where answers can be derived from a single passage, many real-world queries require multi-hop reasoning where evidence must be gathered and synthesized from multiple sources. This setting introduces additional complexity: systems must not only recognize relevant entities and relations but also connect them through multi-step inference chains. Our review and project focus on extending unified QA frameworks to handle multi-hop reasoning while maintaining performance across diverse question types.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Multi-Hop QA Datasets
Yang et al. (2018) introduced HotpotQA, establishing a benchmark for multi-hop reasoning across multiple Wikipedia articles with supporting fact annotations. This dataset has become central for evaluating compositional reasoning over multiple evidence sources.

**Key Papers:**
- Yang et al., EMNLP 2018 - Introduced HotpotQA with diverse reasoning requirements
- Welbl et al., TACL 2018 - Explored multi-hop reading comprehension across documents
- Zhu et al., ACL 2024 - Recent FanOutQA benchmark for multi-document QA

### 3.2  Graph-Based Reasoning
Fang et al. (2020) developed the Hierarchical Graph Network (HGN), constructing multi-layer graphs spanning questions, paragraphs, sentences, and entities. Similarly, Tu et al. (2019) proposed Heterogeneous Document-Entity graphs, using GNNs to aggregate evidence across documents.

### 3.3  Memory-Augmented Models
Li et al. (2022) introduced QA2MN, integrating knowledge-graph embeddings with question-aware memory networks to track entities and relations across reasoning steps, enabling effective evidence chaining.

### 3.4  Unified QA Approaches
Khashabi et al. (2020) proposed UNIFIEDQA, a T5-based text-to-text system trained across multiple QA formats. While optimized for single-hop QA, its flexible framework provides foundation for multi-hop adaptation.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

### Gap 1: Limited Multi-Hop Adaptation of Unified Frameworks
**Why it matters:** Most unified QA systems focus on format generalization rather than reasoning depth, leaving multi-hop capabilities underdeveloped.
**How your project addresses it:** We fine-tune UNIFIEDQA specifically for multi-hop reasoning while maintaining single-hop performance.

### Gap 2: Context Window Limitations in Unified Models
**Why it matters:** Standard UNIFIEDQA has 512-token context window, insufficient for comprehensive multi-document reasoning.
**How your project addresses it:** We integrate a retrieval to focus on most relevant context segments within token limits.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

This study builds upon sequence-to-sequence transformer theory, where questions and contexts are encoded and answers are generated autoregressively. The T5 architecture serves as the core theoretical model, providing strong pretraining across diverse text understanding tasks. The retrieval augmentation extends this framework to handle longer contexts through similarity-based evidence selection.

## 6. Methodology Insights

The most effective multi-hop QA pipelines combine:

- A unified text-to-text architecture (T5-based) for format-agnostic processing
- Retrieval mechanisms (SBERT) for relevant context selection within token limits
- Multi-hop fine-tuning on specialized datasets (HotpotQA)
- Standard QA evaluation metrics (EM, F1) with fuzzy matching for robustness

Our project implements these insights to extend UNIFIEDQA's capabilities while preserving its original strengths.

## 7. Conclusion

The literature reveals two major trends: (1) specialized architectures for multi-hop reasoning (graph networks, memory augmentation), and (2) unified frameworks for format generalization. This project bridges these directions-showing that careful multi-hop fine-tuning of a unified model achieves substantial gains in compositional reasoning while maintaining broad QA capabilities. The resulting UNIFIEDQA-MH forms a strong baseline for future work on general-purpose question answering systems.
