## Abstract

This literature review surveys recent advances in multimodal AI with a focus on integrating audio, visual, and textual modalities. The review traces the evolution from modality-specific models to unified multimodal architectures. It highlights self-supervised learning, modality-agnostic encoders, cross-modal alignment, and efficient architectures for real-world deployment. Key findings emphasize the trade-offs between scalability, efficiency, and performance, while identifying gaps such as reliance on large computational resources and limited cross-modal reasoning in compact models.

## 1. Introduction

Multimodal AI combines information from audio, visual, and text modalities to improve representation learning and downstream task performance. Traditional models were modality-specific, but recent research explores unified frameworks capable of handling multiple input types efficiently. This review examines seminal and state-of-the-art works such as Omnivore, OmniMAE, OneLLM, Qwen2.5-Omni, UniAlign, and UniFormer, and sets the foundation for the proposed OmniQ model, which integrates unified visual encoding with multimodal language models.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Unified Visual Models
- **Girdhar et al., 2022 (Omnivore) [1]** proposed a single transformer-based model for images, videos, and 3D data, treating images as single-frame videos. Strong transferability across visual tasks, but excluded text/audio.
- **Girdhar et al., 2023 (OmniMAE) [2]** introduced masked autoencoding for both images and videos, achieving SOTA on ImageNet and Something-Something V2. Limited to visual modalities.

### 3.2 Cross-Modal Alignment
- **Han et al., 2024 (OneLLM) [3]** unified framework for eight modalities including image, audio, video, point cloud, and text. Used Universal Projection Module for alignment. Strong performance across benchmarks.
- **Xu et al., 2025 (Qwen2.5-Omni) [4]** is an end-to-end multimodal model with Thinker-Talker architecture. Supported text, image, audio, video. Introduced TMRoPE for synchronized temporal processing.

### 3.3 Scalable and Efficient Models
- **Zhou et al., 2025 (UniAlign) [5]** proposed a unified encoder to align multiple modalities while reducing redundancy.
- **Li et al., 2023 (UniFormer) [6]** combined CNNs and ViTs to capture local/global dependencies. Strong vision performance, not fully multimodal.

### 3.4 Additional Recent Works (2023–2025)
- **Chen et al., 2023 (Video-LLM) [7]** proposed large-scale video-language pretraining with hierarchical temporal transformers, achieving improvements in video QA and captioning. Highlighted importance of temporal reasoning.
- **Wang et al., 2024 (AV-HuBERT++) [8]** extended AV-HuBERT to multimodal speech-vision tasks, aligning lip movements with textual tokens for robust audio-visual speech recognition. Improved robustness under noisy conditions.
- **Kumar et al., 2025 (CrossFuse) [9]** introduced a fusion transformer that jointly encodes image, audio, and text using cross-attention bottlenecks, outperforming baselines on multimodal retrieval. Focused on lightweight inference.
- **Zhang et al., 2025 (MM-Bench++) [10]** released a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal reasoning across audio-visual-text tasks, showing limitations of current LLMs in temporal alignment and grounding.

### 3.5 Comparative Analysis of Models

| Paper                     | Approach / Model | Key Contributions | Limitations |  
|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|  
| Girdhar et al. (2022) [1] | Unified transformer-based vision model for images, videos, and 3D data | Modality-agnostic visual encoding, strong transfer across visual tasks, treats images as single-frame videos | Does not handle text or audio |  
| Girdhar et al. (2023) [2] | Unified transformer-based model for images and videos using masked autoencoding | Achieves SOTA on ImageNet (86.6%) & Something-Something V2 (75.5%), efficient with high masking ratios | Limited to visual modalities, no text/audio |  
| Han et al. (2024) [3]     | Unified framework aligning eight modalities | Progressive alignment, trained on 2M multimodal dataset, strong on 25 benchmarks | Needs modality-specific projection, heavy compute |  
| Xu et al. (2025) [4]      | End-to-end multimodal model for text, image, audio, video | Thinker-Talker + TMRoPE, excels in streaming multimodal tasks | Large compute demand |  
| Zhou et al. (2025) [5]    | Unified model aligning multiple modalities through single encoder | Reduces redundancy, scalable | Heavy training compute, lacks real-time optimization |  
| Li et al. (2023) [6]      | Hybrid CNN + ViT | Captures local/global dependencies, strong vision | Complex, not tested on multimodal |  
| Chen et al. (2023) [7]    | Video-LLM with hierarchical temporal transformers | Improves video QA/captioning, stronger temporal reasoning | Dataset-heavy, large compute |  
| Wang et al. (2024)  [8]   | AV-HuBERT++ | Robust AV speech recognition, aligns lip + text tokens | Limited beyond speech tasks |  
| Kumar et al. (2025) [9]   | CrossFuse fusion transformer | Lightweight cross-modal fusion, strong on retrieval | Limited scalability to 4+ modalities |  
| Zhang et al. (2025)  [10] | MM-Bench++ | Benchmark for AV-text reasoning, exposes limitations | Evaluation-only, not a model |  

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

| Gap | Why it Matters | How Project Addresses It |  
|-----|----------------|---------------------------|  
| Efficiency in Large Models | Models like Qwen2.5-Omni require massive compute, limiting deployment | OmniQ applies quantization + sparse attention to reduce inference cost |  
| Visual Encoder Weakness | Multimodal LLMs underperform in video-heavy tasks | OmniQ integrates Omnivore’s modality-agnostic visual encoder |  
| Limited Cross-Modal Masking | Most methods mask only text or visuals, not both | OmniQ extends masked modeling across both modalities |  
| Lack of Robustness in Noisy Inputs | Real-world multimodal data is noisy | OmniQ uses cross-modal augmentation + dropout for robustness |  

## 5. Theoretical Framework

The research builds on self-supervised learning (masked modeling), multimodal fusion (cross-attention), and representation alignment (shared embedding spaces). These provide the foundation for OmniQ: cross-modal masked modeling, robust fusion, and compact inference.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Common methodologies,
- **Self-supervised learning -** Masked modeling (OmniMAE, OmniQ).
- **Cross-modal alignment -** Language as universal anchor (OneLLM, UniAlign).
- **Fusion -** Transformers with LoRA adapters for efficient tuning.

Promising approaches: cross-modal masking, quantization, sparse attention for compact yet accurate performance.

## 7. Conclusion

The literature shows evolution from vision-only learning to multimodal frameworks spanning audio, visual, and text. Current challenges lie in scaling efficiently and handling noisy real-world data. OmniQ addresses these by combining Omnivore’s robust visual encoding with Qwen2.5-Omni’s multimodal reasoning, enhanced by compact optimization. This direction promises scalable, efficient multimodal AI systems.
