## Abstract

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable large parameter counts with modest computation by sparsely activating specialized subnetworks. This review covers the development of MoE in small LLMs, focusing on expert specialization, sparse routing, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and scalable training systems. Key findings highlight that conditional computation, balanced routing, and PEFT methods allow compact LLMs to leverage massive effective capacity, while recent system-level innovations support efficient deployment at extreme scale.

## 1. Introduction

Scaling language models generally improves performance but increases computational cost. MoE layers mitigate this by activating only a subset of experts per token, allowing small LLMs to achieve the performance of much larger dense models. Early work (Jacobs et al., 1991) introduced gating networks for adaptive expert selection, and modern implementations (e.g., GShard, Switch Transformer) have refined sparse gating, load balancing, and expert specialization to maximize efficiency. This review investigates these mechanisms, their effectiveness, and the research gaps in small-LLM MoE deployment.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Early Foundations and Expert Specialization
The evolution of MoE began with Shazeer et al. (2017) introducing sparsely-gated expert networks that achieved large-scale performance improvements with lower computational cost [1]. Lepikhin et al. (2020) extended this in the GShard model, enabling distributed large-scale training using data parallelism and expert partitioning [2]. Fedus et al. (2021) proposed the Switch Transformer, which simplified routing to one expert per token, improving scalability and stability [3]. Later, Zoph et al. (2022) introduced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformers with adaptive routing for stability and efficient load balancing [4].

### 3.2 Efficiency and Scaling for Small Models

Recent studies focus on adapting MoE for small LLMs to achieve high performance under limited resource budgets. Du et al. (2022) presented GLaM, a generalist MoE model using only a subset of experts per token, demonstrating efficiency in scaling down [5]. Lewis et al. (2023) investigated SMoE-LM, a small-scale MoE architecture that maintains modularity and generalization [6]. Zhou et al. (2024) proposed Tiny-MoE, an energy-efficient MoE optimized for mobile and embedded systems [7]. Chung et al. (2023) further examined parameter-efficient fine-tuning in small MoE-LMs, highlighting trade-offs between expert count and latency [8].

### 3.3 Routing and Load Balancing Innovations

Efficient expert routing is critical for achieving stable and balanced performance in MoE systems. Clark et al. (2022) introduced BASE Layers, which improved load balancing using balanced assignment strategies [9]. Roller et al. (2021) enhanced routing stability in Megatron-LM by integrating load-aware gating [10]. Puigcerver et al. (2023) proposed dynamic gating based on reinforcement learning for better expert utilization [11]. Chi et al.

### 3.4 Knowledge Distillation and Compression
Distillation bridges the gap between large MoE models and small efficient ones. Hinton et al. (2015) introduced knowledge distillation as a way to transfer information from large to small networks [13]. Xue et al. (2023) applied MoE-based distillation to small LLMs, improving accuracy while reducing compute requirements [14]. Wang et al. (2024) proposed DistilMoE, a compression strategy that merges multiple experts into compact representations [15]. Yin et al. (2024) developed Prune-and-Distill methods combining expert pruning with soft-target training [16].

The latest works combine Mixture of Experts with other optimization paradigms like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Adapters to achieve fine-tuned control over model efficiency. Hu et al. (2023) integrated LoRA layers with MoE for efficient parameter reuse [17]. Zhang et al. (2025) proposed Hybrid-MoE, combining static and dynamic expert allocation for adaptive inference [18].

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

[Identify gaps in current research that your project could address]

### Gap 1: Limited Application of MoE in Small-Scale LLMs
**Why it matters:** Most MoE studies emphasize large-scale deployment; compact applications remain underexplored.
**How your project addresses it:** By adapting expert routing and pruning strategies for small LLMs.

### Gap 2: Inefficient Routing Mechanisms for Low Compute Devices
**Why it matters:** Load imbalance and routing overhead hinder MoE deployment in mobile systems.
**How your project addresses it:** Introducing lightweight, latency-optimized routing strategies.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

Mixture-of-Experts theory is rooted in conditional computation: a gating function chooses which sub-network(s) to apply per input. This implements a divide-and-conquer strategy where complex tasks are decomposed among experts. Formally, a gate network (often a softmax classifier) computes weights for each expert; top-k selection enforces sparsity. For example, Shazeer et al. describe a trainable gating network that selects a sparse combination of FFN experts for each token. Theoretically, conditional gating allows model capacity to grow without linear compute cost (Bengio et al. 2013; Cho et al. 2014) by activating only a subset of parameters. Routing algorithms (Top-k, BASE, competition) are thus key to realizing this framework in practice.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Recent MoE studies use large-scale empirical benchmarks and hardware metrics to validate their methods. Sparse-architecture papers often measure zero-shot/task performance improvements: DeepSeekMoE shows its 2B model exceeds GShard baselines on 12 diverse benchmarks. Switch Transformer reports pre-training speedups (up to 7× faster than baseline T5) while scaling models to trillion parameters. PERFT and related PEFT works report fine-tuning accuracy on reasoning and QA tasks, demonstrating that tiny adapter-based experts can match full fine-tuning. System papers focus on throughput: MegaBlocks obtains 40% training speedups over Tutel sparse-LM and X-MoE shows linear weak scaling to 1024 GPUs for 545B models. In summary, empirical methodologies combine model-quality benchmarks with efficiency measurements, highlighting trade-offs between routing overhead, parameter count, and hardware utilization.

## 7. Conclusion

Mixture-of-Experts methods are evolving rapidly to make large-parameter models practical. Key trends include more fine-grained experts (DeepSeek) and balanced routing (BASE, CompeteSMoE) to improve specialization; sparse gating techniques (Switch) to simplify computation; and PEFT designs (PERFT, LoRA adapters) to adapt experts cheaply. Training frameworks (MegaBlocks, X-MoE) are pushing the hardware limits of MoE training on GPUs beyond prior scales. These advances imply that even relatively small LLMs can leverage huge effective capacities via conditional sparsity. Future work could integrate these ideas into hybrid MoE architectures that maximize both stability and efficiency, enabling small LLMs to remain compact in latency but vast in knowledge.
