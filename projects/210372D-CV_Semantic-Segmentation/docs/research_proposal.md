## Abstract

This research investigates targeted architectural and training-level enhancements to the SegFormer model for semantic segmentation. Despite SegFormer’s efficiency and performance balance, its lightweight decoder limits fine-grained spatial detail recovery. This study systematically explores decoder-level modifications, introducing Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers, convolutional refinements, and adjusted regularization to evaluate their effect on spatial continuity and feature representation. Using the ADE20K dataset, experiments are conducted under controlled learning schedules to isolate the impact of each structural variation. Comparative evaluation based on mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) is used to determine improvements over the baseline. The expected outcome is a refined segmentation architecture that achieves better balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, contributing to improved understanding of how channel attention and convolutional depth affect transformer-based decoders.

## 1. Introduction

Semantic segmentation enables pixel-level scene understanding, assigning categorical labels to every pixel in an image. This task is critical in applications such as autonomous navigation, satellite imagery interpretation, and medical imaging. With the advent of transformer-based architectures, models like SegFormer have demonstrated high accuracy and computational efficiency by combining multi-scale transformer encoders with lightweight decoders. However, the SegFormer decoder’s minimalistic design, while efficient, may constrain fine-grained feature learning and limit boundary precision. This research focuses on analyzing and enhancing this decoder to improve spatial representation while maintaining SegFormer’s lightweight structure.

## 2. Problem Statement

While SegFormer effectively integrates transformer-based encoding with efficient decoding, its decoder architecture often underperforms in capturing fine spatial detail due to limited local context modeling and reduced feature refinement capacity. The problem addressed in this study is how architectural and regularization modifications to the SegFormer decoder can enhance segmentation accuracy without compromising computational efficiency.

## 3. Literature Review Summary

Recent literature on semantic segmentation highlights transformer-based architectures such as SETR, Swin-Transformer, and SegFormer, which improve global context modeling. SegFormer stands out due to its efficient MiT encoder and simplified decoder. However, studies indicate that lightweight decoders struggle with detailed structure reconstruction compared to deeper convolutional variants. Research incorporating attention modules (e.g., Squeeze-and-Excitation and CBAM) shows potential improvements in channel-wise feature reweighting. Despite this, limited exploration exists on systematically enhancing SegFormer’s decoder through targeted architectural refinements. This gap motivates the present study, focusing on decoder-level adjustments to improve feature continuity and spatial detail representation.

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To enhance SegFormer’s decoder architecture for improved spatial detail recovery and feature representation without significantly increasing computational overhead.

### Secondary Objectives
- To evaluate the effect of extended training schedules and learning rate strategies on decoder stability and convergence.  
- To assess the role of dropout and other regularization mechanisms in decoder generalization.  
- To design and analyze architectural enhancements (e.g., SE layers, additional convolutional layers) for improved pixel-level segmentation accuracy.

## 5. Methodology

### Baseline
The baseline model is SegFormer-B0, pretrained on the ADE20K dataset using standard configurations and the original decoder.

### Experimental Setup
Three modification categories are explored:
1. **Training Schedule Variations:** Extended epochs with fixed and decaying learning rates to test convergence stability.  
2. **Regularization Adjustments:** Dropout removal to assess decoder capacity and generalization.  
3. **Architectural Enhancements:** Integration of SE layers for channel attention, modified 3×3 convolution layers for local refinement, and an additional convolutional layer for post-fusion refinement.

### Dataset and Evaluation
The ADE20K dataset containing 150 classes is used. Preprocessing standardizes input and mask dimensions to 512×512. Models are trained using AdamW optimizer and cross-entropy loss with ignore_index for background. Performance is measured via mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

### Training Details
Each configuration is trained for 30 epochs under uniform conditions on an NVIDIA P100 GPU. Controlled experiments isolate architectural impact from training dynamics.
