## Abstract

This literature review examines the role of activation functions in transformer-based models for abstractive text summarization, with a focus on the PEGASUS-X model. It covers the evolution of transformer architectures for long-document summarization, the theoretical underpinnings of activation functions, and their empirical impact on model performance. Key findings highlight the dominance of GELU in modern transformers, the potential benefits of alternatives like SiLU and ReLU, and the lack of comprehensive studies on activation function modifications in summarization-specific models. The review identifies opportunities for optimizing PEGASUS-X through activation function experimentation to improve efficiency and performance on long inputs.

## 1. Introduction

Abstractive text summarization aims to condense lengthy documents into concise, coherent summaries while preserving key information. Transformer-based models, particularly encoder-decoder architectures like PEGASUS and its extension PEGASUS-X, have achieved state-of-the-art results in this domain. However, the choice of activation functions within these models remains underexplored, despite their critical role in governing convergence, representational power, and overall performance. This review synthesizes literature on transformer architectures for summarization, activation functions in deep learning, and their interplay, providing a foundation for investigating activation function modifications in PEGASUS-X to enhance long-document summarization.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Transformer-Based Models for Abstractive Summarization
Transformer architectures have revolutionized abstractive summarization through self-attention mechanisms and large-scale pretraining. The original Transformer [1] introduced encoder-decoder structures with multi-head attention, forming the basis for models like BERT [2] and GPT. In summarization, BART [3] uses denoising objectives for pretraining, while T5 [4] treats all tasks as text-to-text generation. PEGASUS [5] employs gap-sentences generation for self-supervised pretraining, achieving strong performance on short inputs.

PEGASUS-X [6] extends PEGASUS for long documents (up to 16K tokens) by incorporating block-local attention, staggered blocks, and global tokens. This enables efficient processing of extended contexts, outperforming models like LongT5 [7] on benchmarks such as GovReport and arXiv.

**Key Papers:**
- [3] Lewis et al. - Introduced BART, a denoising sequence-to-sequence model for generation tasks, including summarization.
- [5] Zhang et al. - Proposed PEGASUS with gap-sentences generation, demonstrating superior performance on summarization benchmarks.
- [6] Phang et al. - Developed PEGASUS-X with efficient attention for long inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results on long-document datasets.

### 3.2 Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Long Inputs
Standard transformers suffer from quadratic complexity in attention, limiting scalability. Solutions include sparse attention patterns: Longformer [8] uses local windows and global tokens; BigBird [9] combines local, random, and global attention; LongT5 [7] employs transient global attention. PEGASUS-X integrates block-local attention with staggered boundaries and global tokens to capture both local and global context efficiently.

Hierarchical approaches model document structure: HAT [10] uses sentence-level and document-level layers; HMNet [11] processes turns and meetings hierarchically. Multi-stage summarization, like SUMMN [12], divides inputs into segments for intermediate summaries.

**Key Papers:**
- [7] Guo et al. - LongT5 uses transient global attention for efficient long-sequence processing.
- [8] Beltagy et al. - Longformer enables linear-complexity attention for long sequences using local windows and global tokens.
- [9] Zaheer et al. - BigBird introduces sparse random attention, scaling transformers to longer inputs.

### 3.3 Activation Functions in Deep Neural Networks
Activation functions introduce nonlinearity, enabling complex feature learning. Early models used sigmoid and tanh, but saturating gradients led to vanishing issues [13]. ReLU [14] addressed this with piecewise linearity, promoting sparse representations. Variants like Leaky ReLU [15] and PReLU [16] handle negative inputs.

Smooth functions emerged: ELU [17] and SELU [18] provide exponential behavior. GELU [19], a probabilistic variant of ReLU, weights inputs by Gaussian probability, improving stability in deep networks. SiLU (Swish) [20] combines sigmoid and linear, enhancing gradient flow. SwiGLU [21] gates linear units for better capacity.

In transformers, GELU is default (e.g., BERT, PEGASUS), but alternatives like Swish show promise in vision and NLP tasks [20, 22].

**Key Papers:**
- [19] Hendrycks and Gimpel - Introduced GELU, adopted in major transformers for smoother gradients.
- [20] Ramachandran et al. - Discovered Swish via architecture search, outperforming ReLU in some benchmarks.
- [23] Dubey et al. - Comprehensive survey of activation functions, benchmarking performance across tasks.

### 3.4 Activation Functions in Transformer Models
Transformers rarely revisit activations post-initial design. The original Transformer used ReLU [1], but BERT shifted to GELU. Fang et al. [24] introduced learnable rational activations, improving GLUE and SQuAD scores over fixed GELU. In NLP, Eger et al. [25] compared 21 activations, finding penalized tanh effective.

Summarization models inherit activations without modification. No studies specifically evaluate ReLU vs. GELU in summarization, though GELU's smoothness aids long-context tasks.

**Key Papers:**
- [24] Fang et al. - Learnable activations outperform fixed GELU in BERT-like models.
- [25] Eger et al. - Benchmark of activations across NLP tasks, highlighting stability of alternatives.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

### Gap 1: Lack of Activation Function Studies in Summarization Models
While activation functions are explored in general NLP and vision, their impact on summarization-specific models like PEGASUS-X is unexamined. Existing work focuses on attention or pretraining, ignoring nonlinearity choices.

**Why it matters:** Activation functions affect convergence and representational power, potentially optimizing performance on long documents without architectural overhaul.

**How this project addresses it:** Experimentally replace GELU with ReLU and SiLU in PEGASUS-X, evaluating on diverse datasets to quantify trade-offs.

### Gap 2: Limited Exploration of Alternatives for Long-Document Tasks
Long-document summarization emphasizes efficiency, but activation smoothness for gradient stability in extended contexts is underexplored.

**Why it matters:** Smoother activations may improve stability and quality for complex inputs like GovReport.

**How this project addresses it:** Fine-tune PEGASUS-X variants on long datasets, measuring ROUGE scores to identify optimal activations.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

Activation functions modulate neuron outputs, influencing gradient flow and representational capacity. GELU's probabilistic gating [19] provides smoother transitions than ReLU's hard thresholding, reducing inactive neurons and enhancing feature learning. In transformers, this aids attention mechanisms in capturing nuanced semantics for summarization. Theoretical analyses [20] suggest non-monotonic functions like SiLU balance sparsity and smoothness, potentially benefiting deep encoder-decoder structures.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Common methodologies include fine-tuning pretrained models on summarization datasets, evaluating with ROUGE metrics. Experimental setups vary hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size, using libraries like Hugging Face Transformers. Promising approaches for this project include systematic activation replacement during fine-tuning, controlled comparisons across datasets, and ablation studies on convergence and performance.

## 7. Conclusion

The literature underscores transformers' dominance in summarization, PEGASUS-X's efficiency for long inputs, and GELU's prevalence in activations. However, gaps in activation-specific studies for summarization present opportunities for optimization. This review informs the project's focus on activation modifications to enhance PEGASUS-X, potentially yielding better ROUGE scores and stability. Future work could explore learnable activations or hybrid functions.
