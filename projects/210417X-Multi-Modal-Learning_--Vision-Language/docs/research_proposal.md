## Abstract
This research proposal addresses the challenges of few-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA), a critical task in multi-modal learning that integrates visual and textual reasoning with limited annotated examples. Despite advances in models like Flamingo, which leverages frozen large language models (LLMs) and gated cross-attention, generalization is hindered by noisy, unfiltered visual features and overfitting to small datasets. The proposed study introduces FLAMINGO-VQA, a novel modular enhancement to the Flamingo pipeline, employing three non-trainable techniques: Question-Guided Feature Pre-Selection (QGFP), Semantic Few-Shot Selection (SFS), and Self-Consistency Voting (SCV). QGFP filters irrelevant visual patches, SFS curates relevant exemplars, and SCV stabilizes predictions. The methodology involves evaluating FLAMINGO-VQA on the VQA v2.0 benchmark, aiming for improved accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Expected outcomes include a significant performance boost (targeting >8% accuracy gain over the 31.0% baseline) and a scalable, resource-efficient framework for real-world applications. This work bridges existing gaps in noise mitigation and few-shot adaptability, contributing to the advancement of vision-language systems in constrained environments.

## 1. Introduction
Multi-modal learning, particularly the integration of vision and language, is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, with VQA serving as a key benchmark. The ability to reason across modalities with limited data is vital for applications like assistive technologies and automated content analysis. However, current state-of-the-art models, such as Flamingo, face challenges in generalizing due to noise and overfitting. This research proposes FLAMINGO-VQA to enhance few-shot VQA performance, offering a scalable solution for resource-constrained settings, and holds significance for advancing real-world AI deployment.

## 2. Problem Statement
The research problem is the limited generalization of few-shot VQA models due to the incorporation of noisy, unfiltered visual features and overfitting to small datasets. Existing models like Flamingo, despite their innovative use of frozen LLMs and gated cross-attention, fail to effectively mitigate these issues, reducing accuracy and robustness, particularly in diverse, real-world scenarios.

## 3. Literature Review Summary
Recent literature highlights the evolution of VQA from CNN-RNN models (Agrawal et al., 2017) to transformer-based VLMs like ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019) and Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), which leverage pre-training for few-shot tasks. However, gaps remain in addressing noise in visual feature integration (Tan and Bansal, 2019) and improving generalization in low-data settings (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021). This research targets these deficiencies through modular, non-trainable enhancements.

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To develop and validate FLAMINGO-VQA, a lightweight, non-trainable enhancement to the Flamingo model, achieving improved accuracy and robustness in few-shot VQA.

### Secondary Objectives
- To implement QGFP for effective noise reduction in visual inputs.
- To enhance few-shot adaptation using SFS with semantically relevant exemplars.
- To improve prediction stability through SCV in stochastic settings.

## 5. Methodology
The methodology involves enhancing the Flamingo pipeline with QGFP, SFS, and SCV, using a frozen CLIP text encoder for QGFP and CLIP embeddings for SFS. Data from the VQA v2.0 dataset will be preprocessed to filter noisy patches and select exemplars. The model will be evaluated through ablation studies and threshold sweeps (\(\tau = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7\)) on VQA v2.0, measuring accuracy, robustness, and generalization against the 31.0% baseline, using Python, PyTorch, and GPU hardware.

## 6. Expected Outcomes
The research expects FLAMINGO-VQA to achieve >41.0% accuracy on VQA v2.0, surpassing the 31.0% baseline by at least 10.0 percentage points. It anticipates enhanced robustness to noise and improved generalization across question types, delivering a scalable, resource-efficient framework for few-shot VQA in real-world, constrained environments.
