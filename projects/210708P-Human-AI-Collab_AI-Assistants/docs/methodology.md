## 1. Overview

This research investigates enhancement strategies for LLM-based task planning in multi-model orchestration systems, specifically focusing on improving HuggingGPT's task decomposition capabilities. The methodology employs three complementary techniques: (1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with structured reasoning templates, (2) dynamic example selection based on query characteristics, and (3) self-consistency voting adapted for structured JSON outputs.

The research follows an experimental design with progressive enhancements, evaluating each component individually and in combination using the TaskBench benchmark. This approach aims to establish whether prompt engineering and ensemble methods can significantly improve task planning performance without requiring architectural changes or model fine-tuning, making enhancements immediately deployable in production environments.

## 2. Research Design

### 2.1 Research Approach

**Type:** Empirical experimental study with quantitative evaluation

**Design:** Progressive enhancement methodology with three system variants:
- **Baseline:** Original HuggingGPT implementation (control group)
- **Enhancement 1:** Baseline + Chain-of-Thought prompting
- **Enhancement 2:** Baseline + CoT + Dynamic Selection + Self-Consistency Voting

### 2.2 Research Questions

- **RQ1:** Can Chain-of-Thought prompting improve task planning accuracy in structured prediction tasks?
- **RQ2:** Does dynamic example selection based on query characteristics outperform fixed demonstration sets?
- **RQ3:** Can self-consistency voting reduce hallucinations and improve reliability in JSON-formatted task plans?
- **RQ4:** How do enhancements perform across different task complexities (1-task vs. 4+ tasks) and modalities (text, vision, audio, multimodal)?

### 2.3 Hypotheses

- **H1:** Explicit reasoning steps through CoT prompting will improve F1 score by ≥10% relative to baseline by reducing logical errors in task decomposition.
- **H2:** Dynamic example selection will show larger improvements for non-text modalities (vision, audio) where baseline demonstrations are less relevant.
- **H3:** Self-consistency voting will reduce false positives (hallucinated tasks) by ≥30% through consensus filtering.
- **H4:** Combined enhancements will show synergistic effects exceeding the sum of individual improvements.

## 3. Data Collection

### 3.1 Data Sources

**Primary Dataset:** TaskBench benchmark (Liang et al., 2023)
- **Source:** https://github.com/microsoft/TaskBench
- **Size:** 50 standardized test cases
- **Format:** JSON files containing user queries, ground truth task sequences, and metadata
- **License:** Open source (research use)

**Demonstration Pool:** Custom-curated examples
- **Size:** 15 diverse demonstrations covering different query patterns
- **Categories:** Visual counting, document QA, image generation, audio processing, multimodal tasks
- **Format:** Structured prompts with reasoning templates

### 3.2 Data Description

**TaskBench Distribution:**

| Dimension | Categories | Distribution |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Task Complexity** | 1 task | 24% (12 cases) |
| | 2 tasks | 36% (18 cases) |
| | 3 tasks | 28% (14 cases) |
| | 4+ tasks | 12% (6 cases) |
| **Modality** | Text (NLP) | 18% (9 cases) |
| | Vision | 52% (26 cases) |
| | Audio | 12% (6 cases) |
| | Video | 8% (4 cases) |
| | Multimodal | 10% (5 cases) |
| **Task Types** | Total distinct types | 28 types |

**Example Test Cases:**
- "Can you describe this picture and count how many objects (animals) are in it?" (Vision + counting)
- "I have contract.pdf, what's the termination clause?" (Document QA)
- "In e2.jpg, what's the animal and what's it doing?" (Visual question answering)
- "Generate an image of a sunset over mountains" (Image generation)

**Ground Truth Format:**
```json
{
  "query": "User request in natural language",
  "resources": ["image.jpg", "audio.mp3"],
  "ground_truth_tasks": [
    {
      "task_type": "visual-question-answering",
      "task_id": 0,
      "arguments": {"image": "image.jpg", "question": "..."},
      "dependencies": []
    }
  ],
  "complexity": "medium",
  "modality": "vision"
}
```

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing

**Step 1: Demonstration Pool Construction**
- Manual curation of 15 high-quality examples covering diverse patterns
- Each demonstration includes:
  - User query
  - Structured reasoning (4 steps: goal, capabilities, task selection, dependencies)
  - Ground truth task sequence in JSON format
- Categorization by modality and task type for retrieval

**Step 2: Keyword Extraction**
- Extract domain-specific keywords from queries (e.g., "pdf", "image", "audio", "how many")
- Build keyword vocabulary for category matching
- Assign category bonuses: +3 for document terms with "pdf", +3 for counting with "how many"

**Step 3: TaskBench Preprocessing**
- Load 50 test cases from JSON files
- Validate data completeness (query, resources, ground truth present)
- Extract complexity and modality metadata
- Split into evaluation sets by complexity level for stratified analysis

**Step 4: Prompt Template Construction**
- Design CoT reasoning template with 4 structured steps
- Expand task vocabulary from 24 to 28 types (add: sentence-similarity, image-editing, depth-estimation, pose-detection)
- Create system prompts integrating demonstrations and reasoning instructions

**Data Quality Checks:**
- Verify all 50 test cases have complete ground truth
- Ensure demonstration pool covers all major modalities
- Validate JSON formatting in all examples
- Check for task type consistency across demonstrations

## 4. Model Architecture

```
User Query + Resources
         ↓
[Dynamic Example Selection Module]
         ↓
  Top-4 Demonstrations
         ↓
[Chain-of-Thought Prompt Construction]
         ↓

[GPT-3.5-turbo Inference] ← (3 parallel samples)
         ↓
[Self-Consistency Voting Module]
         ↓

```

### 4.2 Component Specifications

#### 4.2.1 Dynamic Example Selection Module

**Algorithm:** Keyword-based retrieval with category bonuses

**Inputs:**
- User query (string)
- Demonstration pool (15 examples)

**Process:**
1. Extract keywords from query using regex patterns
2. For each demonstration in pool:
   - Calculate keyword overlap score
   - Apply category-specific bonuses:
     - +3 if query contains "pdf" and demo is document-related
     - +3 if query contains "how many" and demo involves counting
     - +3 if query contains "audio/speech/sound" and demo is audio-related
     - +2 if query contains "video" and demo is video-related
3. Rank demonstrations by total score
4. Select top-4 highest-scoring demonstrations

**Output:** Ordered list of 4 most relevant demonstrations

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def dynamic_selection(query, demo_pool, top_k=4):
    keywords = extract_keywords(query)
    scores = []
    
    for demo in demo_pool:
        # Base score: keyword overlap
        overlap = len(keywords & demo.keywords)
        score = overlap
        
        # Category bonuses
        if "pdf" in query and demo.category == "document":
            score += 3
        if "how many" in query and demo.category == "counting":
            score += 3
        if audio_keywords in query and demo.category == "audio":
            score += 3
            
        scores.append((demo, score))
    
    # Sort and select top-k
    scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [demo for demo, _ in scores[:top_k]]
```

#### 4.2.2 Chain-of-Thought Prompt Construction

**Template Structure:**
```
System: You are an AI task planner...

Examples:
[Top-4 selected demonstrations with reasoning]

User Query: [query]

Reasoning:
1. Goal: [Identify user intent]
2. Capabilities: [Enumerate required functions]
3. Task Selection: [Justify choices, consider alternatives]
4. Dependencies: [Analyze execution order]

Tasks: [JSON output]
```

**Reasoning Template Components:**
1. **Goal Identification:** "The user wants to [objective]. This requires [high-level capabilities]."
2. **Capability Analysis:** "Required capabilities include: (1) [capability A], (2) [capability B], (3) [capability C]."
3. **Task Selection:** "I will use [task-type] because [justification]. Alternative tasks like [alternative] are less suitable because [reason]."
4. **Dependency Resolution:** "Task order: [task A] must execute before [task B] because [dependency reason]. Tasks [C] and [D] can run in parallel."

**Token Allocation:**
- Baseline prompt: ~1000 tokens
- CoT prompt: ~1500 tokens (allows reasoning text)
- Max generation: 1000 tokens

#### 4.2.3 Self-Consistency Voting Module

**Sampling Strategy:**
- Sample 1: temperature=0 (deterministic baseline)
- Sample 2: temperature=0.7 (diverse alternative 1)
- Sample 3: temperature=0.7 (diverse alternative 2)

**Voting Algorithm:**

**Inputs:** 3 candidate task plans (JSON lists)

**Process:**
1. Parse each JSON response into task list
2. Convert tasks to signatures: (task_type, sorted_args_key)
3. Build frequency table counting occurrences across samples
4. Select tasks appearing in ≥2 samples (majority threshold)
5. Post-processing:
   - Remove duplicate task IDs
   - Filter invalid task types (not in vocabulary)
   - Correct dependency references (ensure tasks reference valid IDs)
   - Reorder by dependency constraints

**Output:** Consensus task plan (JSON)

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def self_consistency_voting(samples, threshold=2):
    task_counts = defaultdict(int)
    task_details = {}
    
    # Count task occurrences
    for sample in samples:
        tasks = parse_json(sample)
        for task in tasks:
            signature = (task['type'], frozenset(task['args'].items()))
            task_counts[signature] += 1
            task_details[signature] = task
    
    # Select consensus tasks
    consensus = []
    for sig, count in task_counts.items():
        if count >= threshold:  # Appears in ≥2 samples
            consensus.append(task_details[sig])
    
    # Post-process
    consensus = remove_duplicates(consensus)
    consensus = filter_invalid_types(consensus)
    consensus = correct_dependencies(consensus)
    
    return consensus
```

## 5. Experimental Setup

### 5.1 Evaluation Metrics

#### Primary Metrics

**F1 Score** (Primary metric):
```
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```
- Harmonic mean balancing precision and recall
- Task matching based on type and argument similarity
- Range: [0, 1], higher is better

**Precision:**
```
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
```
- Proportion of predicted tasks that are correct
- Measures hallucination rate (lower FP = less waste)
- Critical for production deployment (API costs)

**Recall:**
```
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
```
- Proportion of ground truth tasks correctly identified
- Measures completeness of solutions
- Critical for user satisfaction

#### Secondary Metrics

**Edit Distance** (normalized Levenshtein):
```
Edit Distance = Levenshtein(predicted, ground_truth) / max(len(predicted), len(ground_truth))
```
- Measures sequence-level similarity
- Accounts for task ordering differences
- Range: [0, 1], lower is better

**Task Prediction Statistics:**
- True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted tasks
- False Positives (FP): Hallucinated unnecessary tasks
- False Negatives (FN): Missing required tasks

**Execution Time:**
- Average inference latency per query
- Total API cost estimation (calls × cost per call)

#### Evaluation Protocol

**Task Matching Criteria:**

Two tasks match if:
1. Task types are identical (exact string match)
2. Arguments have ≥80% key overlap
3. Argument values are semantically equivalent

**Statistical Significance:**
- Paired t-test for F1, Precision, Recall comparisons
- Significance level: α = 0.05
- Report p-values for all metric improvements
