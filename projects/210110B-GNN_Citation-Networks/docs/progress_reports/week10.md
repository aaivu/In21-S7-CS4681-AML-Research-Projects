# Week 10 Progress Report
**Focus:** H-UniMP++ implementation and training

## Objectives
- Code uncertainty-gated label injection and curriculum masking within the heterogeneous UniMP framework.
- Execute initial training runs to validate stability on CPU hardware.

## Activities
- Extended `src/models/hetero_unimp.py` with the gating module and curriculum-aware label injection.
- Updated `src/h_unimp_train.py` to enforce CPU-safe settings, add noise regularisation, and log diagnostics.
- Ran iterative training sessions to tune gate bias, masking schedule, and dropout parameters.

## Outcomes
- Successful end-to-end training completing within ~28 minutes per run on CPU.
- Observed gradual improvement in validation metrics as the curriculum progressed.
- Captured debug logs and TensorBoard traces confirming gate activation behaves as expected.

## Next Steps
- Focus on comprehensive testing and quantitative evaluation during Week 11.
