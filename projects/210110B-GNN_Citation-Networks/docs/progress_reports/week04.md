# Week 4 Progress Report
**Focus:** Background study – UniMP foundations

## Objectives
- Review UniMP architecture and training protocol.
- Identify prerequisites for reproducing baseline experiments in PaddlePaddle.

## Activities
- Read Shi et al. (2020) “Masked Label Prediction: Unified Message Passing Model for Semi-Supervised Classification” and highlighted the masked label injection pipeline.
- Mapped model components (feature encoder, label embeddings, aggregation) to available PaddlePaddle primitives.
- Collected implementation references from Baidu PGL examples and noted resource requirements for CPU execution.

## Outcomes
- Detailed notes on UniMP message passing and masking strategy archived in the research notebook.
- Clarified dataset expectations (feature dimensions, label format) for Citation-Network V1.
- Created a checklist of dependencies and configuration parameters needed for baseline setup.

## Next Steps
- Expand the literature survey to complementary heterogeneous GNN work in Week 5.
