# Week 5 Progress Report
**Focus:** Background study â€“ related work expansion

## Objectives
- Survey heterogeneous GNN approaches relevant to UniMP extensions.
- Document gaps motivating relation-aware and uncertainty-aware enhancements.

## Activities
- Reviewed R-GCN, R-GAT, metapath2vec, and R-UniMP papers with emphasis on relation-specific projections.
- Compiled a comparative table of accuracy, input requirements, and compute cost across cited methods.
- Drafted literature review sections summarising strengths and limitations of existing approaches.

## Outcomes
- Consolidated literature notes captured in `docs/literature_review.md`.
- Identified core challenges: label noise sensitivity, fixed masking schedules, and CPU feasibility.
- Prepared reading summaries to inform design decisions for later iterations.

## Next Steps
- Transition from literature study to practical setup of the UniMP baseline in Week 6.
