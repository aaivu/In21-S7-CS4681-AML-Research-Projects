# Week 13 Progress Report
**Focus:** Ablation studies and final paper completion

## Objectives
- Conduct targeted ablation experiments to quantify contributions of gating and curriculum components.
- Finalise the comprehensive project paper integrating all findings.

## Activities
- Ran three ablation variants: (a) no gating, (b) fixed masking, (c) both removed; recorded the drop in Macro-F1.
- Summarised ablation outcomes in narrative and table form for inclusion in the results section.
- Edited the final paper, adding discussion on limitations, future work, and implementation details.
- Ensured repository artefacts (scripts, reports) align with documentation referenced in the manuscript.

## Outcomes
- Ablations confirmed gating contributes +0.5 Macro-F1 and curriculum adds +0.3 Macro-F1 individually.
- Final paper submitted with polished figures, references, and appendices detailing experiments.
- Repository now contains a complete documentation trail from background study through final evaluation.

## Next Steps
- None (project deliverables complete); ready for supervisor review and potential camera-ready revisions.
