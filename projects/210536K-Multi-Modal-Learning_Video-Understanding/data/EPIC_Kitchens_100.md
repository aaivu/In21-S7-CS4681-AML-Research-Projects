# EPIC Kitchens 100 Dataset

**EPIC Kitchens 100** is a large-scale, first-person (egocentric) vision dataset. It's unique because it captures the daily activities of people in their own kitchens, providing a rich and naturalistic view of human-object interactions. The dataset is recorded from a head-mounted camera, offering a first-person perspective of the activities.

## Key Features:

* **Egocentric Viewpoint:** The first-person perspective provides a unique and challenging viewpoint for action recognition models.
* **Unscripted Activities:** The videos capture natural, unscripted activities in real-world kitchen environments.
* **Dense Annotations:** The dataset is densely annotated with action segments, object bounding boxes, and even audio information.
* **Fine-Grained Actions:** It includes a large number of fine-grained action classes, such as "take knife from block" or "put cup in sink".
