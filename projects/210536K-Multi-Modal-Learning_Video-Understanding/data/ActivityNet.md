# ActivityNet Dataset

**ActivityNet** is a large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding. It's designed to help researchers develop models that can recognize a wide range of complex human activities in untrimmed videos. The dataset is organized in a hierarchical structure, with activities grouped into different categories.

## Key Features:

* **Large-Scale and Diverse:** ActivityNet contains thousands of videos, covering over 200 different activity classes.
* **Untrimmed Videos:** Similar to THUMOS14, the videos in ActivityNet are untrimmed, which means the activities are embedded within longer video sequences.
* **Temporal Annotations:** The dataset provides temporal annotations for the start and end times of each activity instance.
* **Hierarchical Structure:** The activities in ActivityNet are organized in a semantic hierarchy, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between different activities.
