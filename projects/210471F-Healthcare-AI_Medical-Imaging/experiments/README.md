# Experiments and Preliminary Results

Our technical validation of the proposed architecture's design principles suggests a clear performance advantage over single-branch models. The results from our initial experiments with different transfer learning backbones will be discussed comprehensively here.

## Results from Initial Architectures
Before implementing the data augmentation pipeline, a substantial class imbalance was observed between the COVID-19 and Non-COVID categories in the dataset. To address this imbalance and improve model generalization, we experimented with different loss functions in a 5-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Specifically, we utilized **Focal Loss** and **Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE)** as alternatives to the standard Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss.

**The Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE)** introduces class-dependent weighting factors that assign higher penalties to misclassified samples of the minority class. It is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{WBCE}} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} 
\Big[ w_{p} \, y_i \log(p_i) + w_{n} \, (1 - y_i) \log(1 - p_i) \Big]
$$

where `y_i ∈ {0, 1}` denotes the ground-truth label for sample `i`, `p_i` represents the predicted probability, and `w_p` and `w_n` correspond to the weights assigned to the positive (COVID-19) and negative (Non-COVID) classes, respectively.

The **Focal Loss**, on the other hand, dynamically scales the cross-entropy loss by a factor that down-weights well-classified examples and focuses more on hard or misclassified samples. It is mathematically expressed as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{Focal}} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Big[ \alpha (1 - p_i)^{\gamma} y_i \log(p_i) + (1 - \alpha) p_i^{\gamma} (1 - y_i) \log(1 - p_i) \Big]$$


where `α` is the class-balancing parameter and `γ` is the focusing parameter that adjusts the rate at which easy examples are down-weighted.

Both Focal Loss and WBCE achieved identical improvements over the baseline BCE loss, effectively mitigating the impact of class imbalance. This confirms that incorporating class-aware weighting mechanisms significantly enhances classification performance in imbalanced medical imaging datasets, even before applying data augmentation techniques.

During the architectural design phase, several established backbones (e.g., ResNet-50, EfficientNetB1) were initially evaluated on the training data using basic transfer learning to establish a performance baseline.

| ConvNeXt-Base       | 0.9681   | 0.9606   | 0.9694   | 0.9648   |

According to **Table 2**, we anticipate that the **ConvNeXt-based architecture**, due to its enhanced feature extraction capabilities and modern architectural design, will significantly outperform traditional CNN models. The preliminary findings strongly suggest that ConvNeXt produces superior feature map representations, resulting in better separability of features.

Furthermore, as shown in **Table 3**, which presents the results of existing studies conducted on the same dataset, it is evident that the **proposed method** has already outperformed previous approaches utilizing similar transfer learning techniques. This improvement can be attributed to our **enhanced data preprocessing pipeline** and **two-phase multibranch learning strategy**. Building upon these promising findings, we aim to further optimize and push the performance boundaries by adopting **ConvNeXt-based architectures** as the next phase of our research.

## Impact of the Multi-branch Fusion
The main innovation, the multi-branch pooling mechanism, is the primary driver of the performance gain. By combining GAP (global context), GMP (salient details), and the Attention-weighted Pooling (AWP, dynamically weighted saliency), the model is engineered to achieve a more complete and robust representation of the pathological features. The AWP specifically is intended to leverage the channel-wise importance learned by the attention mechanism to ensure subtle, yet critical, low-contrast features are not averaged out by conventional pooling. This architectural separation will result in a more generalizable classifier.
