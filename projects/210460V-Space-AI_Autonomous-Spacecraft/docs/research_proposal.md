## Abstract
Autonomous spacecraft rendezvous requires generating dynamically feasible and fuel-efficient trajectories in complex orbital environments. Traditional optimization-based methods, while precise, are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time decision-making. Recent data-driven approaches, such as the **Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART)**, reformulate trajectory generation as a sequence modeling problem using Transformer architectures trained on convex optimization datasets. However, ART and similar imitation-based models remain fundamentally data-driven and may violate orbital physics under extrapolated conditions.  
This proposal introduces a **Physics-Aware Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (PA-ART)** - a hybrid framework that integrates physical dynamics into Transformer-based trajectory prediction. By embedding orbital motion constraints through a physics-consistency loss and multi-step rollout regularization, PA-ART ensures predictions that are dynamically valid, fuel-efficient, and stable over long horizons. The study aims to enhance physical reliability in deep learning-based trajectory models and bridge the gap between analytical astrodynamics and modern sequence learning architectures.

## 1. Introduction
In modern space operations, autonomous rendezvous and docking are critical for satellite servicing, debris removal, and deep-space exploration. These missions require highly reliable trajectory planning systems that can operate without continuous ground intervention.  
Machine learning methods, particularly Transformers, have shown remarkable performance in sequence modeling tasks. The **Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART)** has demonstrated the ability to imitate optimal orbital maneuvers generated from convex solvers. Yet, ART’s data-driven nature causes it to deviate from real orbital dynamics when applied to unseen conditions, limiting its operational trustworthiness.  
Integrating physics-awareness into ART presents an opportunity to produce models that are both data-efficient and physically grounded—essential qualities for the next generation of intelligent space systems.

## 2. Problem Statement
While existing Transformer-based models for trajectory generation effectively learn from optimal datasets, they lack physical interpretability and often produce dynamically inconsistent trajectories when extrapolated.  
The key problem addressed in this research is:  
> **How can we enhance the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer to generate physically consistent, dynamically feasible, and long-horizon stable spacecraft trajectories?**

## 3. Literature Review Summary
Recent advances in **Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)**, including *Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)* and *PDE-Transformers*, have shown that embedding physical equations into neural architectures improves generalization and stability.  
PINNs incorporate differential equation residuals into the loss function, ensuring physical consistency during training. Meanwhile, Transformers with embedded physics constraints have demonstrated long-term predictive stability in fluid and structural dynamics.  
However, their application to **space trajectory optimization** remains largely unexplored. Existing ART models, though data-efficient, disregard orbital dynamics in their learning process.  
This gap motivates the development of **Physics-Aware ART (PA-ART)** - an approach that integrates orbital mechanics into Transformer learning through a physics-based loss function and rollout consistency regularization.


## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To develop a Physics-Aware Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (PA-ART) that integrates orbital dynamics into Transformer-based trajectory learning to ensure physically consistent and feasible spacecraft trajectories.

### Secondary Objectives
- To design and implement a **physics-consistency loss** based on orbital propagation residuals.  
- To introduce a **multi-step rollout regularization** term for enforcing long-horizon stability.  
- To evaluate PA-ART against baseline ART models using state, control, and physics residual metrics.  
- To analyze trade-offs between data-driven imitation and physics-based regularization.  

## 5. Methodology
The methodology will follow a hybrid simulation-learning pipeline:
1. **Dataset Generation:**  
   Generate optimal rendezvous trajectories using convex optimization under linearized orbital dynamics (ROE/RTN states).
2. **Preprocessing:**  
   Normalize trajectories, compute orbital parameters, and derive training–validation splits.
3. **Model Development:**  
   Extend the baseline ART with additional physics-consistency and rollout loss terms. Implement exponential moving average (EMA) updates for stability.
4. **Training and Validation:**  
   Train on convex-optimized datasets and validate across varying orbital regimes.  
   Use quantitative metrics such as total loss, physics residuals, MSE@k, and feasibility ratio.
5. **Comparison and Evaluation:**  
   Compare PA-ART with the baseline ART to assess improvements in physical consistency and long-horizon convergence.

## 6. Expected Outcomes
- A trained **Physics-Aware ART model** that produces dynamically feasible trajectories while maintaining optimal control accuracy.  
- Quantitative improvement in state and physics residual losses compared to baseline ART.  
- Demonstrated long-horizon stability and reduced trajectory divergence.  
- A framework applicable to broader physics-informed Transformer research and autonomous guidance applications.
