## Abstract

This research proposes an enhanced version of TS2Vec that significantly improves forecasting accuracy through a novel hybrid ensemble architecture. The approach combines learned temporal representations from TS2Vec with explicit temporal feature engineering through adaptive ensemble weighting. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on learned representations, our hybrid approach integrates domain knowledge via sinusoidal time features that capture cyclical patterns often underweighted in pure representation learning models. The methodology employs validation-based weight optimization for each dataset and prediction horizon, enabling automatic adaptation to different forecasting scenarios. Experimental evaluation on Energy Transformer Temperature (ETT) datasets demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple forecasting horizons, with particular effectiveness for long-term predictions. The research contributes both algorithmic innovation through hybrid ensemble design and empirical insights into the complementarity of learned versus engineered temporal features for time series forecasting.

## 1. Introduction

Time series forecasting is a critical task across numerous domains, from energy management and smart grid operations to financial markets and industrial monitoring. The emergence of deep representation learning methods, particularly TS2Vec, has shown remarkable success in learning universal time series representations through contrastive learning. However, existing approaches primarily rely on purely data-driven feature learning, potentially missing explicit temporal patterns that domain knowledge can provide.

The Energy Transformer Temperature (ETT) datasets represent a particularly challenging forecasting domain, involving multivariate time series with complex temporal dependencies and clear cyclical patterns. While TS2Vec excels at capturing complex non-linear relationships through its hierarchical contrastive learning framework, it may underweight regular temporal cycles that are crucial for accurate long-term forecasting in energy systems.

This research addresses the fundamental question of how to optimally combine learned representations with explicit temporal knowledge to enhance forecasting performance. The significance lies in developing a principled approach to hybrid feature learning that maintains the flexibility of representation learning while incorporating the reliability of engineered temporal features.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Core Problem
Existing time series forecasting methods face a critical trade-off between the flexibility of learned representations and the reliability of explicit temporal features. TS2Vec, while powerful in learning complex patterns, may inadequately capture regular cyclical behaviors essential for accurate forecasting in domains with strong temporal structure.

### Specific Challenges
1. **Feature Complementarity Gap:** No systematic approach exists to combine TS2Vec representations with explicit temporal features
2. **Ensemble Weight Optimization:** Current methods lack principled approaches for optimizing ensemble weights across different forecasting horizons
3. **Domain Adaptation:** Existing ensemble methods do not adapt to dataset-specific characteristics and horizon-dependent patterns
4. **Evaluation Limitations:** Insufficient comparative analysis between pure representation learning and hybrid approaches

### Research Questions
1. Can explicit temporal features complement learned TS2Vec representations to improve forecasting accuracy?
2. How should ensemble weights be optimized to balance learned and engineered features across different prediction horizons?
3. What is the optimal integration strategy for combining data-driven and domain-knowledge-based temporal features?

## 3. Literature Review Summary

### Foundation Work: TS2Vec
TS2Vec (Yue et al., 2022) introduced hierarchical contrastive learning for universal time series representation, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks. The method learns representations by contrasting augmented views of time series at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective transfer learning and few-shot learning scenarios.

### Ensemble Methods in Time Series
Traditional ensemble approaches (Kang et al., 2017; Montero-Manso et al., 2020) focus on combining predictions from multiple forecasting models. However, these methods typically ensemble at the prediction level rather than the feature level, missing opportunities for deeper integration of complementary information sources.

### Temporal Feature Engineering
Classical approaches (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2018) emphasize explicit temporal features like seasonality, trends, and cyclical patterns. Recent work (Wu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022) has shown that combining learned and engineered features can be beneficial, but lacks systematic approaches for optimization.

### Identified Gaps
1. **Limited Hybrid Approaches:** Few methods systematically combine representation learning with explicit temporal features
2. **Lack of Adaptive Weighting:** Existing ensemble methods use fixed weights rather than adapting to horizon and dataset characteristics
3. **Insufficient Evaluation:** Limited comparative analysis of the complementarity between learned and engineered features
4. **Domain Specificity:** Most approaches are domain-agnostic, missing opportunities for domain-specific temporal pattern integration

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
Develop and evaluate a hybrid ensemble architecture that combines TS2Vec learned representations with explicit temporal features through adaptive weighting to achieve superior forecasting performance compared to pure representation learning approaches.

### Secondary Objectives
- **Algorithmic Innovation:** Design a validation-based ensemble weight optimization strategy that adapts to different forecasting horizons and datasets
- **Feature Integration:** Develop principled methods for combining TS2Vec embeddings with engineered temporal features at the feature level
- **Empirical Analysis:** Quantify the complementarity between learned and explicit temporal features across different prediction horizons
- **Reproducibility Contribution:** Provide comprehensive technical documentation and open-source implementation for research community adoption
- **Domain Application:** Demonstrate effectiveness specifically for energy system forecasting using ETT datasets
