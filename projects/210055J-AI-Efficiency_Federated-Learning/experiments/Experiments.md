## 1. Overview

The experimental study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed **Local–Global Knowledge Regularization (LGKR)** enhancement to Federated Averaging (FedAvg) under heterogeneous, non-IID data conditions. The goal was to measure improvements in convergence stability, communication efficiency, and fairness compared to the baseline FedAvg algorithm.

All experiments were implemented using a federated learning framework (e.g., PyTorch + Flower/FedML) and executed on GPU-enabled systems to ensure consistency across runs.

## 2. Experimental Setup

### 2.1 Federated Learning Environment
- **Framework:** PyTorch with a custom FedAvg implementation.  
- **Server:** Coordinates rounds, model aggregation, and client sampling.  
- **Clients:** Emulated participants, each owning a local dataset partition.  
- **Communication Protocol:** Identical to FedAvg — no protocol modifications.  
- **Client Participation:** A fixed subset of clients per round (typically 10–20%).  
- **Local Optimizer:** SGD with momentum and fixed learning rate.  
- **Rounds:** 500 total communication rounds.  
- **Local Epochs:** 5 epochs per client per round.  

### 2.2 Experimental Factors
The experiments varied several key hyperparameters and configurations:
- **Regularization Weight (λ):** Controls contribution of KD loss (tested values: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0).  
- **Temperature (T):** Controls softening of teacher predictions (tested values: 1, 2, 4).  
- **Confidence Threshold (τ):** Filters low-confidence predictions (τ = 0.5).  
- **Warm-Up Schedule:** Gradual increase of λ during early rounds.  
- **Client Sampling Rate:** Varied to simulate partial participation effects.

## 3. Datasets

Experiments were conducted on three standard federated benchmarks that simulate different types of heterogeneity:

### 3.1 MNIST
A balanced digit classification dataset split into **non-IID shards**, where each client receives samples from only a few digit classes.  
- **Purpose:** To test the approach under strong label imbalance.  
- **Model:** Lightweight CNN with two convolutional and two fully connected layers.

### 3.2 CIFAR-10
A natural image dataset with 10 classes and higher visual variability.  
- **IID Split:** Uniform random distribution across clients.  
- **Non-IID Split:** Each client receives samples from 2–3 classes.  
- **Purpose:** To analyze the effect of LGKR on vision tasks with moderate complexity.  

### 3.3 Shakespeare
A character-level language modeling dataset derived from the *Shakespeare* plays in the LEAF benchmark.  
- **Client Definition:** Each speaking role acts as a unique client.  
- **Purpose:** To evaluate the performance of LGKR under natural language heterogeneity.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to assess both accuracy and stability:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Global Accuracy** | Test accuracy after each communication round. |
| **Rounds-to-Target Accuracy** | Number of rounds required to reach a predefined accuracy threshold. |
| **Final Accuracy** | Average accuracy after 500 rounds. |
| **Variance of Client Accuracies** | Measures fairness and stability under non-IID conditions. |
| **Convergence Stability** | Smoothness and consistency of global performance over rounds. |

---

## 5. Baseline Comparison

The baseline model used **standard FedAvg** with:
- Cross-entropy loss only  
- Identical learning rate and batch size  
- No additional regularization or teacher model  

The **proposed method** differs only in the client-side training objective:
- Adds the knowledge-distillation term  
- Keeps server aggregation and communication cost identical  

This design ensures that any observed improvement is solely due to the local–global regularization mechanism.

## 7. Ablation Studies

### 7.1 Distillation Weight (λ)
- λ = 0.5 yielded the most balanced performance.
- Higher λ values (≥2.0) constrained local learning and slightly reduced accuracy.  
- The sensitivity was mild, indicating robustness to parameter choice.

### 7.2 Temperature (T)
- Moderate temperature (T = 2) provided smoother convergence and higher generalization.  
- Too low (T = 1) or too high (T = 4) degraded performance slightly.

### 7.3 Confidence Threshold (τ) and Warm-Up
- Confidence thresholding (τ = 0.5) prevented noisy teacher signals.  
- λ warm-up improved stability in early rounds, especially on CIFAR-10.

## 8. Observations

- Improvements from LGKR are **incremental but consistent** across datasets.  
- The method stabilizes training over time, even when early rounds exhibit mixed results.  
- Gains are achieved with **no extra communication cost** and **minimal computation** (one extra forward pass per batch).  
- FedAvg oscillations are reduced, and fairness across clients improves slightly.  

---

## 9. Limitations and Future Work

- The accuracy improvements, though consistent, remain modest (+0.8% to +1.9%).  
- Hyperparameters λ, T, and τ may need dataset-specific tuning.  
- The method’s behavior under adversarial or byzantine clients has not yet been tested.  
- Future work includes:
  - Adaptive λ scheduling based on client data quality  
  - Integration with server-side adaptive optimizers (e.g., FedAdam)  
  - Scaling to large transformer-based federated tasks  
  - Extending to multimodal or cross-device settings

## 11. Conclusion

The conducted experiments demonstrate that **Local–Global Knowledge Regularization** offers a practical enhancement to FedAvg. It achieves better convergence stability, fairness, and efficiency under non-IID conditions while keeping the server and communication architecture untouched. The simplicity, low overhead, and empirical gains make it a promising direction for more robust and scalable federated learning systems.
