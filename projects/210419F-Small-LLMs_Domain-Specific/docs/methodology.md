## 1. Overview

This methodology outlines a comprehensive approach to developing an efficient clinical natural language processing model through the integration of adaptive tokenization and knowledge distillation. The research addresses the performance gap between general-purpose lightweight models (DistilBERT) and domain-specific models (BioClinicalBERT) by creating a unified framework that combines vocabulary enhancement with task-specific knowledge transfer. The approach aims to achieve ClinicalBERT-level accuracy in Medical Entity Recognition while maintaining DistilBERT's computational efficiency, representing a novel contribution to the field of domain-specific small language models.

## 2. Research Design

### 2.1 Research Approach
This study employs an **experimental research design** with controlled comparisons across multiple model configurations. The methodology follows a **two-stage enhancement approach**:

1. **Stage 1**: Adaptive tokenization enhancement through statistical analysis and vocabulary extension
2. **Stage 2**: Task-specific knowledge distillation with temperature-scaled soft target learning

### 2.2 Theoretical Framework
The research is grounded in three theoretical foundations:

**Information-Theoretic Tokenization**: Based on KL divergence analysis to identify domain-specific tokens that minimize information loss during text segmentation, following Sachidananda et al. (2021)'s efficient domain adaptation framework.

**Knowledge Distillation Theory**: Implementing Hinton et al.'s teacher-student paradigm with temperature scaling, enhanced by recent advances in Transformed Teacher Matching (TTM) that incorporates Rényi entropy regularization for improved generalization.

**Domain Transfer Learning**: Applying principles from medical NLP domain adaptation while maintaining computational efficiency constraints essential for practical deployment in clinical environments.

### 2.3 Hypotheses
**H1**: Adaptive tokenization enhancement will improve medical term representation quality, leading to better semantic understanding of clinical concepts.

**H2**: Task-specific knowledge distillation from ClinicalBERT will transfer domain expertise to the enhanced DistilBERT model while preserving computational efficiency.

**H3**: The integrated approach will achieve performance comparable to ClinicalBERT (within 2-3% F1 score) while maintaining DistilBERT's inference speed advantages.
