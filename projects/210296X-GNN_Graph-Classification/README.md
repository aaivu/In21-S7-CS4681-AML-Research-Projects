# GNN:Graph Classification - 210296X

# Enhancing-GraphMAE
Enhancing Graph Masked Autoencoders (GraphMAE) with Few-Shot Graph Learning

## 🚀 Run on Google Colab

You can run this notebook directly on **Google Colab**.

> 💡 Recommended Runtime: **T4 GPU**  
> (Go to: *Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU → T4*)

All required dependencies are automatically installed when running the notebook.  

## ⚠️ Note on Datasets and Experiments

- The **datasets are automatically downloaded** when you run the notebook — no manual download is needed.  
- All **experimental results** are **printed directly in the notebook cells**.  

## ⚠️ Note on Opening the Notebook

Even you encounter a message saying **"Invalid Notebook"** when trying to preview this notebook directly on GitHub,  — this happens because of missing widget metadata in the notebook file (`metadata.widgets`).

> 💡 **Workaround:**  
> You can still run the notebook perfectly fine in **Google Colab** by following these steps:
>
> 1. Click the **“Download raw file”** option (top right of the notebook preview on GitHub).  
> 2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
> 3. Upload the downloaded `.ipynb` file to Colab.  
> 4. Set **Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU → T4 (Preferred)**.  
> 5. Run all cells — the notebook will execute normally.  

## ⚠️ Note on Dependencies

If any dependency fails while running the notebook, simply run the below on the first cell :  
 
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
> This will install the original versions of all packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
