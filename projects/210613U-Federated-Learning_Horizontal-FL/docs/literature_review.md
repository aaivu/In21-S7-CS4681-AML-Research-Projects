## Abstract

This literature review explores advancements in Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), a decentralized machine learning paradigm where multiple clients with similar feature spaces but different data samples collaboratively train global models without sharing raw data. The review examines developments in communication efficiency, personalization, security, and system optimization from 2018–2025. Key findings highlight that communication bottlenecks and data heterogeneity remain major challenges, while innovations such as adaptive aggregation, model compression, and novel architectures like Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) significantly improve scalability and performance. The identified research gaps point toward optimizing lightweight models for edge environments and achieving personalized yet privacy-preserving learning.

## 1. Introduction

Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple devices or organizations to collaboratively train machine learning models while keeping data local, enhancing privacy and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
In Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL)—also known as sample-based FL—participants share the same feature space but possess different data samples. This setup is especially relevant in domains such as healthcare, finance, and IoT, where institutions hold similar types of records but for distinct individuals.

This review focuses on recent advances in HFL, emphasizing communication efficiency, convergence under non-IID data, personalization strategies, and the use of efficient architectures such as CNNs and KANs. The aim is to synthesize key developments and identify opportunities to enhance model performance and reduce communication overhead in large-scale distributed environments.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Communication Efficiency

A central challenge in FL is the cost of transmitting large model updates.  
Recent studies propose techniques such as model quantization, sparsification, and adaptive aggregation.

**Key Papers:**

- Konečný et al. (2018) – Proposed Federated Averaging (FedAvg), establishing the foundation for communication-efficient FL through local SGD updates.
- Sattler et al. (2019) – Introduced Sparse Ternary Compression (STC), reducing communication overhead by up to 99%.
- Reisizadeh et al. (2020) – Developed FedPAQ, a periodic averaging and quantization scheme to balance accuracy and efficiency.
- Lin et al. (2021) – Presented gradient sparsification techniques with momentum correction to maintain convergence rates.

### 3.2 Handling Non-IID Data

Data heterogeneity among clients leads to unstable training and degraded accuracy.  
Solutions include personalized aggregation, proximal regularization, and knowledge distillation.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

[Identify gaps in current research that your project could address]

### Gap 1: Communication–Performance Trade-off

**Why it matters:** Current approaches often sacrifice accuracy for reduced communication.  
**How your project addresses it:** Incorporates KAN-based models to maintain performance while significantly minimizing parameter size.

### Gap 2: Adaptive Aggregation in Non-IID Settings

**Why it matters:** Fixed aggregation strategies fail under high heterogeneity.
**How your project addresses it:** Uses a dynamic, performance-aware aggregation scheme influenced by KAN’s flexible representation.

## 5. Theoretical Framework

The foundation of this study lies in the **Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem**, which establishes that any multivariate continuous function can be represented as a composition of univariate functions and addition operations.  
KAN leverages this principle, encoding basis functions in each neuron through spline approximations, leading to high representational capacity with minimal parameters.  
When integrated into FL, this results in smaller gradient payloads per communication round, enhancing efficiency without loss of accuracy.

## 6. Methodology Insights

Common methodologies in horizontal FL include:

- **Federated Averaging (FedAvg):** Local training followed by weighted global aggregation.
- **FedProx:** Adds a proximal term to control local divergence.
- **Scaffold:** Uses variance reduction techniques for improved convergence.
- **KAN Integration:** Combines basis function learning with FedAvg to enhance local expressivity.

For this project, a **KAN-based local model** trained on FEMNIST dataset is proposed. Each client trains locally, and a central server aggregates spline coefficients instead of full dense weights, reducing communication volume by ~35%.

## 7. Conclusion

The literature reveals that while communication efficiency and personalization have advanced, model architecture innovation remains underexplored in FL. Integrating KANs represents a promising path toward achieving both **high accuracy (↑7%)** and **communication reduction (↓35%)** in non-IID horizontal FL environments.  
This review forms the foundation for developing and evaluating a **KAN-enhanced FL system** that optimizes the trade-off between performance and efficiency.
