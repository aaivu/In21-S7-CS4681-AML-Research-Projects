## Abstract

his research aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative self-correction strategies. The project focuses on improving the OpenO1-LLaMA-8B-v0.1 model—one of the two models released under the OpenO1 initiative—through the application of multi-turn RL (SCoRe framework) and cooperative multi-agent reasoning. The methodology combines training-time optimization using reward shaping with generation-time correction and feedback-guided decoding to enable real-time reasoning refinement. By incorporating frameworks such as Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) and CORY-inspired cooperative RL, the research targets improvements in mathematical reasoning, general problem-solving, and multi-domain knowledge comprehension. Evaluation across reasoning benchmarks—GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, ARC-C, HellaSwag, and BBH—will determine the impact of iterative refinement and self-correction on accuracy, consistency, and robustness. The expected outcome is a scalable and adaptable reasoning enhancement pipeline that contributes to the broader goal of developing autonomous self-correcting AI systems capable of deeper and more reliable reasoning.

## 1. Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation. However, despite their scale, these models often struggle with consistent reasoning and self-correction. The ability to reason through multi-step problems and revise incorrect reasoning remains a major limitation. This research explores how reinforcement learning and iterative self-correction can be leveraged to overcome this challenge, improving models’ logical consistency and accuracy. Building on the OpenO1-LLaMA-8B-v0.1 baseline—a model demonstrating competitive reasoning performance—this project seeks to establish a structured methodology to enhance its reasoning and self-reflective capabilities using reinforcement learning and generation-time refinement.
## 2. Problem Statement

Although LLMs exhibit impressive linguistic fluency, they often fail at structured reasoning tasks and are prone to hallucination, inconsistency, and error propagation. Traditional fine-tuning and prompt-based correction methods yield limited improvements and often lack scalability. There is a need for a robust training framework that enables models to iteratively self-correct and improve reasoning accuracy through both learning-time and inference-time refinement.

## 3. Literature Review Summary

Recent literature highlights the evolution of reasoning improvement in LLMs through three major directions:

Prompting-based self-correction (e.g., Huang et al., 2023; Qu et al., 2024) has shown limited reliability due to dependence on weak prompts or absence of ground truth.

Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning (e.g., Christiano et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2024) enables structured reward-driven training for better reasoning alignment, exemplified by frameworks such as RLHF, ReST, and SCoRe.

Generation-time correction and multi-agent approaches (e.g., Wang et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024) enhance reasoning without retraining by using collaborative agents and feedback-guided decoding.

However, there remains a gap in integrating these strategies into a unified pipeline that balances efficiency, scalability, and measurable reasoning improvement. This project addresses that gap.

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To enhance the reasoning performance of the OpenO1-LLaMA-8B-v0.1 model using reinforcement learning and iterative self-correction frameworks.
### Secondary Objectives
Implement the SCoRe multi-turn RL framework to enable self-correction-based fine-tuning.

Incorporate multi-agent strategies (Mixture-of-Agents and CORY-inspired RL) to encourage cooperative reasoning.

Apply generation-time correction methods for inference-level refinement.

Evaluate performance across standard reasoning benchmarks to measure reasoning consistency and robustness.

## 5. Methodology

The proposed approach follows a three-stage methodology:

Baseline Setup:
Deploy OpenO1-LLaMA-8B-v0.1 as the foundation model and benchmark its initial reasoning performance on GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, ARC-C, HellaSwag, and BBH datasets.

Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (SCoRe Framework):

Stage I – Initialization: The model learns to generate a first attempt close to the base model while optimizing the second attempt for high-reward responses using KL-divergence and reward shaping.

Stage II – Multi-Turn RL: Both attempts are jointly optimized, rewarding improved second-attempt corrections and penalizing regressions.

Iterative Self-Correction and Multi-Agent Enhancement:

MoA-Inspired Iteration: Multiple agents collaboratively refine responses layer-by-layer.

CORY-Inspired RL: Pioneer and observer agents alternate roles to promote cooperative policy learning and diversity in reasoning strategies.

Generation-Time Correction:
Implement generate-then-rank and feedback-guided decoding to refine reasoning dynamically during inference.

Evaluation:
Compare performance against baseline and intermediate models using accuracy, reasoning depth, consistency, and robustness metrics across benchmarks.

## 6. Expected Outcomes

Enhanced reasoning and self-correction capabilities of OpenO1-LLaMA-8B-v0.1.

A hybrid RL and self-correction framework applicable to other reasoning models.

Improved accuracy and consistency on mathematical, commonsense, and multi-domain reasoning tasks.

A published paper outlining methodology, experiments, and comparative results.
