## 1. Overview
This methodology focuses on enhancing reasoning capabilities in OpenO1-LLaMA-8B-v0.1 through reinforcement learning (RL), iterative self-correction, and generation-time refinement. Building upon insights from recent literature such as SCoRe (Kumar et al., 2024) and multi-agent frameworks (Ma et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024), the study aims to train the model to self-correct reasoning errors, integrate cooperative feedback, and achieve higher consistency in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks.

The approach involves three core stages: (1) baseline benchmarking, (2) SCoRe-based RL fine-tuning for self-correction, and (3) iterative multi-agent reasoning for refinement.
## 2. Research Design

The research follows an experimental design combining supervised and reinforcement learning with multi-agent collaboration. The workflow includes:

Baseline Assessment — Evaluate OpenO1-LLaMA-8B-v0.1 on reasoning benchmarks.

Fine-Tuning via Reinforcement Learning (SCoRe) — Apply a two-stage RL process emphasizing iterative self-correction and reward shaping.

Iterative and Multi-Agent Self-Correction — Extend the fine-tuned model using Mixture-of-Agents and CORY-inspired cooperative learning strategies.

Generation-Time Refinement — Implement feedback-guided decoding to allow real-time reasoning corrections without retraining.

This structured progression enables systematic comparison of reasoning performance across stages.
