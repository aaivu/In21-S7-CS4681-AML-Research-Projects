  "U production would be needed. In its October 2015 plan, NNSA identified an option of reprocessing spent U.S. nuclear fuel to obtain unobligated HEU that could be downblended to LEU and used for tritium production. However, this option was not ultimately included in NNSA’s October 2016 mission need statement. This option was not ultimately included in NNSA’s October 2016 mission need statement. According to NNSA and ORNL documents, the small centrifuge experiment will take 3.5 years to achieve a TRL of 3 to 4—successful validation at laboratory scale—and cost approximately $42 million for this validation effort. During our visit to ORNL in December 2016, laboratory representatives told us that prototypes had not yet been constructed and showed us their preliminary design work and initial construction of their facility. However, in February 2016, Centrus had already publicly announced that it would begin decontamination and decommissioning the demonstration plant in spring 2016. An alternate scenario—complete demobilization of the demonstration plant followed by a restart of operations after 10 years—may have more closely reflected conditions at the time. According to a December 2014 estimate provided by Centrus to DOE and N The following is a summary of our assessments. Comprehensive. Best practices state that—to be considered comprehensive—a cost estimate should include both government and contractor costs of the project over its full life cycle, from “cradle to grave.” This includes costs from the inception of the demonstration plant followed by a restart of operations after 10 years—may have more closely reflected conditions at the time. According to a December 2014 estimate provided by Centrus to DOE and N The following is a summary of our assessments. Comprehensive. Best practices state that—to be considered comprehensive—a cost estimate should include both government and contractor costs of the project over its full life cycle, from “cradle to grave.” This includes costs from the inception of the project through design, development, deployment, and operation and maintenance, to retirement of the project. A life cycle cost estimate can support budgetary decisions, key decision points, milestone reviews, and investment decisions. DOE Order 413.3B does not specifically require a life cycle cost estimate at CD-0. Nonetheless, according to best practices, two actions involve nuclear material accounting practices that help preserve supplies of unobligated LEU, and two of the actions involve downblending HEU. NNSA has generally identified the costs and schedules for these actions.",
  "-lowering modification, and, according to FHA officials, some modifications could increase monthly payments for borrowers with a large number of missed payments. As discussed later, our analysis found that outcomes can vary greatly by purchaser, and purchasers may not offer comparable modification options. See appendix IV for information on the types of modifications purchasers have used. Furthermore, FHA may not have the data it needs to evaluate whether payment-lowering modifications offered by purchasers remain sustainable. In the second 2016 sale, FHA began requiring that modified interest rates be fixed for at least 5 years and thereafter that they not increase by more than 1 percent per year. In 2017, FHA also began requiring purchasers to report data related to interest rates for modified loans, including the modified interest rate and the number of years it would remain fixed. In 2017, FHA began requiring borrowers to report data related to interest rates for modified loans. In 2017, FHA began requiring borrowers to report data related to interest rates for modified loans, including the modified interest rate and the number of years it would remain fixed. However, based on our review of reported modification information, none of the purchasers from this sale reported these rates. Additionally, about 22 percent of the modifications offered to borrowers whose loans were sold in the 2015 sale and later included a deferment. These rates generally exceeded the foreclosure and short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure estimates for similar, unsold loans (34 and about 9 percent, respectively). Further, the share of loans sold through NSO pools relative to national pools has increased, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales. As noted previously, NSO and nonprofit pools have additional regulatory requirements, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales. FHA has additional regulatory requirements, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales. As discussed in appendix VII, FHA has additional regulatory requirements, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales.

  ". U.S. Virgin Islands Housing Finance Authority and the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the 2017 CDBG-DR grantees in those jurisdictions. To determine the status of the 2017 CDBG-DR grants, we reviewed relevant laws and the Federal Register notices allocating the CDBG-DR funds and interviewed HUD officials to determine the steps grantees were required to take before signing a grant agreement and expending their 2017 CDBG-DR funds. We reviewed key documents—such as documentation on financial processes and procedures, implementation plans, and action plans—to determine when they were submitted and approved. To determine how much CDBG-DR funding the 2017 grantees had drawn down, we examined data from the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting system as of January 2019 (the most recent month available during our review). To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed relevant documentation on the system and interviewed officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting CDBG-DR grantees.

CPD field office staff generally manage all other grantees. To determine how much CDBG-DR funding the 2017 grantees had drawn down, we examined data from the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting system as of January 2019 (the most recent month available during To identify GAO reports, we used the search engine on GAO’s public website and searched for relevant terms such as “community development block grant,” “Sandy,” “Katrina,” and “Gulf Coast” from August 2005 (the month of the 2005 hurricanes) to April 2018 (the date of the search). To identify HUD OIG reports, we reviewed disaster-related reports the HUD OIG made available on its public webpages titled “Disaster Oversight Highlights,” “Disaster Oversight Highlights,” “Superstorm Sandy,” and “Hurricane Katrina.” To identify Congressional Research Service reports, HUD officials told us that a permanently authorized CDBG-DR program would allow HUD to issue permanent",

In addition, CSBS said that these efforts could benefit from the participation of state regulators and that it would be willing to participate if invited. Similarly, CSBS expressed support for our recommendations that certain federal agencies formally evaluate the feasibility and benefit of establishing an office of innovation or clear contact point and formally evaluate the feasibility and benefit of adopting knowledge-building initiatives related to financial innovation. However, CSBS also cautioned that the volume of lending by 13 of the most significant lenders had reached about $61 billion as of the end of September 2016, and other market monitors estimate that fintech lending volumes could grow to as much as $90 billion to $122 billion by 2020.

  " policy statement for CSPF to eliminate asset allocation targets for each asset class and instead specified that the plan invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 25 percent in nonpublicly traded assets. After 1999, CSPF’s investment policy under other, successive named fiduciaries continued to be broad and generally specified that the plan should invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities. Specifically J.P. Morgan’s and Northern Trust’s consecutive investment policies for part of the plan’s assets continued to specify that a majority of the plan’s assets be invested in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 25 percent in nonpublicly traded assets. Goldman Sachs’ investment policy for another part of the plan’s assets did not specify asset allocation details but indicated slightly higher tolerance for risk in conjunction with its equity portfolio. CSPF trustees said that named fiduciaries considered investing in alternative assets, but instead chose to increase the plan’s allocation to equity assets. The named fiduciaries’ investment policies did not vary significantly over this period because CSPF trustees said that the plan’s investment return was the same as the investment return calculation. The plan’s investment return was the same as the investment return calculation. The plan’s investment return was the same as the investment return calculation. The plan’s investment return was the same as the investment return calculation. The plan’s investment return was the same as the investment return calculation. The named fiduciaries’ investment policies did not vary significantly over this period because CSPF trustees said that the plan’s CSPF’s asset allocation and the median allocation of its assets were the same as the median portfolio allocations for the group of CSPF’s peers. Table 2 compares CSPF’s asset allocations for selected asset categories to the median allocations of its TUCS comparator group. In 1996, compared to the TUCS medians, CSPF had relatively lower proportions of its assets in both equities and fixed income and a relatively higher proportion in real estate. Twenty years later (2016), CSPF had relatively higher proportions of its assets in both equities, fixed income, retirement ages, and other economic and demographic assumptions. Under the standards, a plan must collect a minimum level of contributions each year to show progress toward meeting its target, or the plan",
  " level for the LCR. EPA has efforts underway to reconsider the action level for the LCR, which may include a change in the action level from one that is based on technical feasibility, to one that also considers lead exposure in vulnerable populations such as infants and young children, which EPA refers to as a health-based benchmark. EPA anticipates issuing comprehensive revisions to the LCR by February 2020. While the 3Ts guidance is not contingent on the LCR, EPA officials told us they would consider updates to the 3Ts guidance, including the 20 ppb action level, as they consider revisions to the LCR. By updating the 3Ts guidance to include an action level for school districts that incorporates available scientific modeling regarding vulnerable population exposures, EPA could have greater assurance that school districts are able to limit children’s exposure to lead in school drinking water. EPA has emphasized the importance of addressing elevated lead levels in school drinking water. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead in drinking water. EPA could have greater assurance that school districts are able to limit children’s exposure to lead in school drinking water. EPA has emphasized the importance of addressing elevated lead levels in school drinking water through its 3Ts guidance, but has not communicated necessary information about action levels and other key topics consistent with the external communication standard under federal standards for internal control. According to EPA, CDC, and others, eliminating sources of lead before exposure can occur is considered the best strategy to protect children from potential adverse. In response to our recommendation to improve Education’s websites, Education said it would identify and include an information portal dedicated to enhancing the usability of federal resources related to testing for and addressing lead in school drinking water. Also, Education said it is interested in increasing coordination across all levels of government and it shares the view expressed in our report that improved federal coordination, including with EPA, will better enhance collaboration to encourage testing for lead in school drinking water. Education said it would develop a plan for disseminating relevant resources to its key stakeholder groups and 59 percent informed parents about their plans to test; similar percentages provided information about the testing results. We identified a range of approaches to communicating testing efforts in the 17 school districts we interviewed. Some school districts reported issuing press releases, putting letters in multiple languages in students’ backpacks, sending emails to parents",
  " that the Select Agent Program did not consistently refer laboratories to investigative entities for violations of the select agent regulations or enforce regulations related to incidents involving incomplete inactivation, and we found that this appears to be true beyond incidents involving incomplete inactivation as well. Senior program officials told us that, even without joint strategic planning documents, the CDC and APHIS components of the Select Agent Program manage fragmentation by collaborating on many aspects of the program, such as through maintaining frequent communication at the director level. They also said that the program had not developed a joint mission statement or strategic planning tools in the past because they prioritized other efforts in recent years, including responding to incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2015, addressing recommendations from recent reports, and developing a new database for the Select Agent Program. In addition, each component of the program has generally focused on its own agency’s needs when conducting workforce planning.

In addition, each component of the program has generally focused on its own agency’s needs when determining the focus of their inspections. For example, according to agency officials in Great Britain and Canada, because they have not found stringent inventory requirements to be effective in reducing biological safety risks in the laboratory, neither country places as much focus, time, or resources on inventory management as the Select Agent Program does. Some other regulatory sectors in the United States are also structurally independent from regulated facilities as a mechanism to ensure independence. For example, we and other audit organizations are subject to an external peer review at least once every 3 years that includes a review of documentation related to independence, among other issues. According to senior program officials we interviewed, the program as a whole has not engaged in comprehensive risk management activities but they would be willing to do so in the future.

  ", or releases of larger projects. For example, the Defense investment in our sample was the seventh increment of an ongoing investment; Energy’s system was the first of two phases; the DHS investment was rolled out to two locations prior to deployment to 37 additional locations; and Transportation’s investment had been part of a prototype deployed to four airports. Common factors critical to the success of three or more of the seven investments were: 1. Program officials were actively engaged with stakeholders. 2. Program staff had the necessary knowledge and skills. 3. Senior department and agency executives supported the programs. 4. End users and stakeholders were involved in the development of requirements. 5. End users participated in testing system functionality prior to formal end-user acceptance testing. 6. Government and contractor staff were stable and consistent. 7. Program officials maintained regular communication with the prime contractor. 8. Programs received sufficient funding. These critical factors help support OMB’s objective of improving the management of large-scale IT acquisitions across the federal government. In addition, officials stated that they have worked to develop a culture shift for the business customers who were accustomed to having a different set of roles and responsibilities in the traditional software development process than what is used in the incremental development process. In addition, officials stated that they have worked to develop a culture shift for the business customers who were accustomed to having a different set of roles and responsibilities in the traditional software development process than what is used in the incremental In addition, GSA officials stated that they had used existing governance bodies and processes to determine whether the investment would be certified. The officials stated that they did not see a reason to create a separate policy for CIO certification, since the agency always looks at using incremental development for new projects and the agency certifies the investment in the major IT business case. Further, OPM officials stated that their agency had been on a path to address the FITARA requirements, but progress was slowed due to the lack of a budget for fiscal year 2017. The officials stated that they have not seen the need to address the FITARA requirements for CIO certification for the major IT investments, but progress was slowed due to the lack of a budget for fiscal year 2017. The officials stated that they intend to update the agency’s policies, in accordance with OMB’s guidance on the implementation of FITARA.

In our study, we conducted a study of the Long Island Sound watershed in the United Kingdom in 2015. During the course of our work, we shared with Study members our concern that only 2 of the 20 long-term targets have intermediate targets. In response, in web pages for the 20 targets available in June 2018, the Study had established intermediate targets for an additional 10 of the 18 long-term targets that did not have intermediate targets. In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets that did not have intermediate targets. In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets that did not have intermediate targets.
