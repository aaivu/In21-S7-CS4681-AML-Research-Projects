  " interstate agents, PHMSA regional officials stated that they needed interstate agents to supplement their current allocation of federal inspectors. For instance, in one region, PHMSA officials said that if interstate agent agreements were discontinued, the region would need to hire 3 to 4 additional inspectors. In another region, officials said that interstate agents provided the equivalent of 5 to 10 additional inspectors. Officials in one PHMSA region said that, although the region could absorb the interstate agent workload if needed, doing so would lead to less extensive inspections because there would more pipelines to inspect with fewer federal inspectors. Interstate agents may also enhance pipeline safety oversight within their state by going above and beyond the annual inspection activities required under their agreement with PHMSA. Specifically, as part of the annual inspection planning process, PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agents to develop an annual inspection plan. While interstate agents must prioritize PHMSA’s inspection priorities, such as participation in new construction inspections and PHMSA-led systems inspections, they can also propose additional inspections of interstate pipelines. At the federal level, PHMSA is responsible for developing regulations for domestic interstate and intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. Its regulatory programs are focused on ensuring safety in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of pipelines.

At the federal level, PHMSA is responsible for developing regulations for domestic interstate and intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. Its regulatory programs are focused on ensuring safety in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of pipelines. Inspectors from PHMSA’s five regional offices and states are responsible for inspecting nearly 3,000 miles of pipelines. Each year, PHMSA uses its Risk Ranking Index Model (RRIM) as one input to determine its annual inspection priorities. Each year, PHMSA uses its Risk Ranking Index Model (RRIM) as one input to determine its annual inspection priorities, they can also propose additional inspections of interstate pipelines within their state. Officials in half of the nine states with interstate agent agreements stated that they proposed and obtained PHMSA’s approval for additional pipeline inspections that would not otherwise have been included in PHMSA’s annual inspection plan. For instance, PHMSA’s Western Region reported that between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016 Washington State’s pipeline safety agency—which holds an interstate agent agreement—proposed and conducted 13 inspections beyond those identified in PHMSA’s inspection plans. During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. Some violations, including the four illustrative examples below, were deemed serious enough that PHMSA imposed civil penalties. In 2015, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection inspected an interstate pipeline that was deemed unsafe.

In 2015, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection inspected an interstate pipeline that was deemed unsafe by PHMSA. PHMSA officials we spoke with noted that the role of state inspectors can vary based on the levels of training and knowledge among state inspectors. PHMSA officials told us they intend to clarify this role for states. From fiscal year 2012 to 2017, PHMSA’s funding increased by nearly 40 percent, allowing the agency to hire additional pipeline inspectors. In the past 7 years, four additional state pipeline safety agencies have applied for interstate agent agreements. New Hampshire: In 2014, the state legislature passed a law requiring the state’s pipeline safety agency to apply for interstate agent status on an annual basis. State pipeline safety officials cited New Hampshire inspectors’ local knowledge of interstate pipelines, as well as concerns over the frequency of PHMSA’s interstate pipeline inspection activity, as reasons for seeking an agreement. To date, PHMSA has not accepted the state agency’s annual applications for interstate agent status citing an increase in the federal inspection workforce, a preference for states to focus on intrastate pipeline inspections, and a preference for states to focus on intrastate pipeline inspections. To date, PHMSA has not accepted the state agency’s annual applications for interstate agent status citing an increase in the federal inspection workforce, a preference for states to focus on intrastate pipeline oversight, and the ability for state agencies to participate in interstate inspections through other means, such as temporary interstate agreements.

  "VA’s mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans in recognition of their service to the nation by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials. In carrying out this mission, the department operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the United States, providing health care services to approximately 9 million veterans throughout the United States, Philippines, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. In 2015, we designated VA health care as a high-risk area for the federal government, and we continue to be concerned about the department’s ability to ensure that its resources are being used cost-effectively and efficiently to improve veterans’ timely access to health care. In part, we identified limitations in the capacity of VA’s existing IT systems, including the outdated, inefficient nature of certain systems and a lack of system interoperability as contributors to the department’s challenges related to health care. In part, we identified other VistA- related technology investments, such as VistA- related technology investments, such as networks and infrastructure sustainment, continuation of legacy systems, and overall patient safety, security, and system reliability. Table 1 provides a summary of the total VistA and related obligations that VA identified for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. Understanding the scope of VA’s current health information system is essential to effectively planning for the new system. However, according to VA officials, there is no single information source that fully defines the scope of VistA.

Table 1 provides a summary of the total VistA and related obligations that VA identified for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. Understanding the scope of VA’s current health information system is essential to effectively planning for the new system. However, according to VA officials, there is no single information source that fully defines the scope of VistA. Instead, existing definitions of VistA, including the components that comprise VistA are used to determine the scope of VistA. VistA has been essential to the department’s ability to deliver health care to veterans. VistA contains an electronic health record for each patient that supports clinical settings throughout the department. For example, clinicians can use the system to enter and review patient information; order lab tests, medications, diets, radiology tests, and procedures; record a patient’s allergies or adverse reactions to medications; request and track consults; enter progress notes, diagnoses, and treatments for encounters; and enter discharge summaries. VistA was developed in house by clinicians and IT personnel in various VA medical facilities and has been in operation since the early 1980s. Over the last several decades, VistA has evolved into a technically complex system comprised of about 170 modules that support health care delivery at 152 VA Medical Centers and over 1,200 outpatient sites. In addition, VistA contains an electronic health record for each patient that supports clinical settings throughout the department. VistA has been essential to the department’s ability to deliver health care to veterans. The identification of such site specific customization is intended to help Cerner plan for implementation of its system at each location. Our experience has shown that challenges can successfully be overcome through using a disciplined approach to IT acquisition management.

  " integration and testing is the phase in which problems are most likely to be found and schedules tend to slip. For a uniquely complex project such as JWST, this risk is magnified. Now that the project is well into its complex integration and test efforts, events are sequential in nature and there are fewer opportunities to mitigate issues in parallel. As shown in the figure below, Northrop Grumman’s work on the spacecraft element remains on the project’s critical path—the schedule with the least amount of reserve, which determines the overall schedule reserve for the project—now with an estimated 1.5 months of schedule reserve to the end of the launch window in June 2019. Given several ongoing technical issues, and the work remaining to test the spacecraft element and complete integration of the telescope and spacecraft, combined with continuing slower than planned work at Northrop Grumman, we believe that the rescheduled launch window is likely unachievable.

For the past 44 months, Northrop Grumman’s actual workforce has exceeded its projections and the company is not expected to significantly reduce its workforce until the spring of 2019, when NASA plans to ship the completed observatory to the launch site. Additionally, the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The hardware configuration created when the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module were integrated, referred to as OTIS, is not considered an element by NASA, but we categorize it as such for ease of discussion. Additionally, JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope, and to collect and transmit data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts. See figure 1 for an interactive graphic that depicts the elements and major subsystems of JWST. For the majority of work remaining, the JWST project is relying on Given the remaining integration and test work ahead—the phase in development where problems are most likely to be found and schedules tend to slip—and risks remaining to be reduced to acceptable levels, coupled with a low level of schedule reserves, we believe that additional delays to the project’s launch readiness date are likely. Since our last report, the JWST project has made considerable progress toward completing its third and fourth of five total integration and test phases for the combined optical telescope element and integrated science instrument module (OTIS) and the spacecraft elements, respectively. Previously, the project’s analysis determined that the expected durations provided by Northrop Grumman were overly optimistic. As a result, the project incorporated uncertainty factors into the analysis, which added 2 to 3 months to the schedule. Northrop Grumman has needed to maintain higher workforce levels due to technical challenges and the work taking longer than expected. Figure 6 illustrates the difference between the workforce levels that Northrop Grumman projected for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and its actual workforce levels during that period.

  "The National 911 Program is in the early stages of establishing a National NG911 Roadmap. As stated above, officials stated it may be appropriate for agencies participating in the roadmap initiative to perform specific tasks after the roadmap is finalized. We have previously examined interagency collaborative mechanisms and identified certain key issues for federal agencies to consider when using these mechanisms to achieve results. Our prior work has found that following leading collaboration practices, such as clarifying roles and responsibilities of agencies engaged in collaboration, can enhance and sustain collaboration among agencies and provide an understanding of who will do what in support of meeting the aims of the collaborative group. As stated above, the RFP specifies that a roadmap developed by and adopted by 911 stakeholders could serve as a blueprint to carry out the roadmap’s tasks. Securing the commitment of agencies to assigned roles could help organize the collaborative group’s joint and individual efforts and thereby better facilitate decision making. As we have previously found, a lack of clarity on the roles and responsibilities of agencies participating in an interagency effort—such as the execution of the roadmap’s tasks—may limit agencies’ abilities to effectively achieve shared objectives.

We assessed the National 911 Program’s planned activities for the national roadmap project against federal internal control standards and selected key practices to enhance interagency collaboration identified in our prior work. In other states, 911 governance structures vary among states. These varying governance structures may pose different challenges. For example, some states have a centralized structure in which a single government agency is responsible for statewide 911 system’s administration and policy. Officials in two states told us that although they faced challenges transitioning to NG911, their states’ centralized 911",
  " reported that CMS and the HHS-OIG had identified a number of areas of concern in Medicaid that have hindered or hindered the success of audits. We recommended that CMS address the barriers that limit state participation in collaborative audits, including their use in managed care delivery systems. CMS concurred with this recommendation and has taken steps to address them for a number of states, but has not yet made such changes accessible to a majority of states. State auditors and federal partners. We have found that state auditors and the HHS-OIG offer additional oversight and information that can help identify program risks. To that end, we routinely coordinate our audit efforts with the state auditors and the HHS-OIG. For example, we have convened and facilitated meetings between CMS and state audit officials to discuss specific areas of concern in Medicaid and future opportunities for collaboration. The state auditors and CMS officials commented on the benefits of such coordination, with the state auditors noting that they can assist CMS’s state program integrity reviews by identifying program risks. State auditors also have conducted program integrity reviews to identify improper payments and deficiencies in the processes used to identify them. We believe that these reviews could provide insights into the appropriateness of managed care spending. The following are recent examples of reviews conducted: In 2017, the Oregon Secretary of State Audits Division found approximately 31,300 questionable payments to Coordinated Care Organizations (which receive capitated monthly payments for beneficiaries, similar to managed care organizations), based on a review of 15 months of data. We believe that these reviews could provide insights into program risks in Medicaid managed care. This potential understatement of the program risks in managed care also may curtail investigations into the appropriateness of managed care spending.

We believe that these reviews could provide insights into program risks in Medicaid managed care. We believe that these reviews could provide insights into program weaknesses that CMS could learn from and potentially address nationally. Coordination also provides an opportunity for state auditors to learn methods for conducting program integrity reviews. The following are recent examples of reviews conducted: The continued growth of Medicaid managed care makes ensuring the accuracy of managed care improper payment estimates increasingly important. In May 2018, we acknowledged that although CMS has increased its focus on and worked with states to improve oversight of Medicaid supplemental care; its efforts—for example, updated regulations and audits of managed care providers—did not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable costs. In May 2016, CMS updated its regulations for managed care programs, including that states arrange an independent audit of the data submitted by MCOs, at least once every 3 years. We found that this requirement has the potential to enhance state’s per capita income in relation to the national average per capita income. States have flexibility in determining how their Medicaid benefits are delivered. For example, states may (1) spent funds states can accrue for each year of a demonstration, and has also reduced the amount of unspent funds that states can carry forward to new demonstrations. For 10 demonstrations it has recently approved, HHS estimated that the new policy has reduced total demonstration spending limits by $109 billion for 2016 through 2018, the federal share of which is $62.9 billion. These limits reduce the effect, but do not specifically address all, of the questionable methods and assumptions that we have identified regarding how HHS sets demonstration spending limits. Evaluation of Medicaid demonstrations. In a January 2018 report, we questioned the usefulness of both state-led and federal evaluations of section 1115 demonstrations, particularly with regard to how these evaluation results may inform policy decisions. State-led evaluations. In February 2016 we reported that CMS did not have written guidance that clarifies this policy. In February 2016, we found examples of hospitals with large uncompensated costs associated with serving the low-income and Medicaid population that received relatively little in supplemental payments, while other hospitals with relatively low uncompensated care costs—but that were able to contribute a large amount of funds for the state’s Medicaid share— received large supplemental payments relative to those costs.

  "Our simulations also provide a baseline from which to view the experiences of individual state and local governments. Finally, assessing the fiscal outlook of the sector as a whole can help mitigate the tendency to extrapolate from the most visible, but potentially not representative, experiences of individual states or localities. Our baseline approach to simulating the fiscal outlook for the state and local government sector is described in appendix I. As part of our simulation approach, we used five variables with values for the simulation period—the period from 2018 through 2092—that are projected outside the model and that do not rely on maintaining historical relationships. Our main indicator of the sector’s fiscal balance is its operating balance net of funds for capital expenditures (henceforth, operating balance), which is a measure of the sector’s ability to cover its current expenditures out of current revenues. Our simulations suggest that state and local governments will need to make policy changes to avoid fiscal imbalances before then and assure that revenues are at least equal to expenditures. Our main indicator of the sector’s fiscal balance is its operating balance net of funds for capital expenditures (henceforth, operating balance), which is a measure of the sector’s ability to cover its current expenditures out of current revenues. The operating balance is defined as total receipts minus (1) capital outlays not financed by medium- and long-term debt issuance, (2) total current expenditures less depreciation, (3) current surplus of state and local government enterprises, and (4) net social insurance fund balance. Alternative indicators of fiscal balance include net saving and net lending or borrowing. Net saving is the difference between current receipts and current expenditures. Net saving is the difference between current receipts and current expenditures. Since current expenditures exclude capital investment but include a depreciation measure, net saving can be thought of as a measure of the extent to which governments are covering their current operations from current receipts. For our baseline simulations, we projected real U.S. GDP to grow at the same rate as Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections for the period from 2018 through 2028 and to grow at the same rate as the OASDI Trustees’ intermediate projections of real U.S. GDP. We concluded that the variables were cointegrated if we rejected the null hypothesis of no relationship at standard significance levels. Current tax receipts. These receipts are tax payments made by persons or businesses to state and local governments. They include income taxes, general sales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes. However, they exclude fixed capital consumption. The former three categories are cash expenditures, while the latter is a noncash charge. Net lending or net borrowing represents the governments’ cash surplus or borrowing requirement. This measure is normally negative because governments borrow to finance their capital investment. This measure is normally negative because governments borrow to finance their capital investment. This measure is normally negative because governments borrow to finance their capital investment (and sometimes to finance current operations as well). The following equations describe how we simulated state and local government receipts and expenditures. These receipts are grouped in five main categories. Current expenditures. These receipts include interest, dividends, and rental income, Similarly, future changes in the real amount of state and local government expenditures will be a function of past changes in real wages and salaries. As indicated in table 3, we used a weighted average of past values of the state and local government employment cost index to simulate the employment cost index for state and local government retirees. Our method for simulating the sectors’ short-term debt outstanding leverages the fact that for any entity, there is a direct relationship between budget outcomes and changes in financial position. Specifically, if expenditures exceed receipts, the gap needs to be financed by some combination of changes in financial assets and changes in financial position. In addition, under TCJA, the amount of the federal itemized deductions allowed for all state and local income, sales, and property taxes (commonly referred to as the state and local tax (SALT) deduction) is now capped at $10,000 for tax years 2018 to 2025. The magnitude or net effect of these changes is uncertain in that states are still working to understand the impact of the tax laws on their revenues and that the difference between revenues and expenditures would become increasingly negative during the next several decades. The relationship between budget outcomes and the sector’s financial position is shown in the following accounting identity: total receipts – total expenditures = change in financial assets less the change in financial liabilities divided by the number of retirees. The sector’s net financial investment (the change in financial assets minus the change in financial liabilities) must equal the budget surplus. The relationship between budget outcomes and the sector’s financial position is shown in the following accounting identity: total receipts – total expenditures = change in financial assets – change in financial liabilities. The sector’s financial liabilities include short-, medium-, and long-term debt; trade payables; and loans from the sector. The sector’s liabilities include short-, medium-, and long-term debt;",
  "DOD guidance states that the Air Force is attempting to address the competing demands for limited adversary air to grow as the Air Force stands up more F-35 squadrons. The Air Force recognizes and is attempting to mitigate adversary air shortfalls. For example, the Air Force has hired contractors to address Air Force adversary air shortfalls at exercises, as we previously reported. The Air Force is specifically responsible for gaining and maintaining air superiority. The Air Force Strategic Master Plan states that the Air Force must focus clearly on the capabilities that will allow freedom of maneuver and decisive action in highly contested spaces, including high-end air capabilities. Fifth generation fighter capabilities and ready and trained Airmen who are properly equipped for their missions are central components of the Air Force’s ability to provide air superiority in contested environments. The F-22 is the Air Force’s fifth generation, air superiority fighter that incorporates a stealthy and highly maneuverable airframe, advanced integrated avionics, and engines capable of sustained supersonic flight. Fourth generation fighters do not have to contend with this maintenance issue. The F-22’s LO coating is actually a series of coatings that require diligent and time-consuming application and curing.

The Air Force has begun to address these maintenance issues by using a more durable coating and standing up additional repair facilities. The Air Force has begun to address these maintenance issues by using a more durable coating and standing up additional repair facilities. Second, the F-22 faces a number of supply challenges that have contributed to reduced and unpredictable aircraft availability. Officials from all four operational locations expressed concerns over low supply levels and difficulties with obtaining needed parts. The F-22 fleet’s small size and resulting low demand for parts contributes to this problem. Obtaining missing parts can be a time-consuming and costly process because some original manufacturers no longer make the parts or are completely out of business, according to Air Force officials. When this is the case, the Air Force may need to find the original aircraft and parts design plans, and obtain a new contractor to produce a small number of parts. Officials from all four operational locations expressed concerns over low supply levels and difficulties with obtaining needed parts. The F-22 fleet’ F-22 squadrons DOD’s Joint Publication 3-0, Joint Operations, states that risk management is the process to identify, assess, and control hazards arising from operational factors and make decisions that balance risk and cost with mission benefits. It assists organizations and individuals in making informed decisions to reduce or offset risk, thereby increasing operational effectiveness and the probability of mission success. The second option, called cannibalization, is an inefficient way to conduct maintenance because it doubles the work. A good part needs to be removed from one aircraft and put into another. Once the replacement part arrives, it needs to be installed on the cannibalized aircraft. Once the replacement part arrives, it needs to be installed on the cannibalized aircraft. Once the replacement part arrives, it needs to be installed on the cannibalized aircraft. There is also a chance that the cannibalized part could get damaged in the process or just not work. Further, cannibalization could result in additional LO repairs on the donor aircraft. An Air Force report summarizing fiscal year 2016 maintenance issues reported that F-22 pilot air superiority skills degrade while on deployment because they are conducting CAS missions and not able to train for their air superiority missions, according to Air Force officials. The F-22’s small fleet size also exacerbates supply challenges it is facing with its engines, potentially falling below minimum spare part requirements for multiple calendar years. Further, the F-22’s role has also evolved since 2010. For example, F-22s have begun participating in combat operations in Iraq and Syria. Additionally, potential adversaries are increasingly able to challenge U.S. air superiority, according to Air Force officials. In 2016, the Air Force examined its future air superiority capability needs in its Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan, but that review did not include an assessment of organizational structure. Such an assessment could consider a number of alternatives, such an assessment could",
  "nonrecurring costs will likely lead to a loss of sale. DOD guidance states these waiver requests should include information on competing items and their cost, if available; however, the guidance does not specify the type of information or level of detail that should be provided. DSCA officials stated that they interpret this guidance to mean this information is optional and therefore not required. According to DOD officials, a foreign government’s budget constraints could limit its ability to pay nonrecurring costs. Of the 18 loss of sale waiver requests that we reviewed, none included any additional information on competing offers or spending limits, beyond the basic loss of sale statement. Even if DOD received this type of information from the foreign government, DSCA officials told us that corroborating this information would be difficult. Therefore, DOD officials stated that they do not assess the likelihood of loss of sale beyond the minimum criteria. Although this assessment requires no additional analysis, loss of sale waiver requests are subject to the same review process, but with OUSD Policy as another required layer of review, bringing the possible total up to 12 offices. DSCA and OUSD Policy officials were unsure of the origin of the requirement for OUSD Policy to weigh in on waiver requests that cite loss of sale. Further, OUSD Policy officials stated that they do not assess the likelihood of loss of sale beyond the minimum criteria.

The first phase of the FMS process generally involves a foreign government submitting a request, usually to State or DOD, to express interest in purchasing defense articles or services. Depending on the size and complexity of the items being purchased and the foreign government’s available budget, the process to finalize the terms of a sale can take from a few days to years. In response to concerns that the FMS process is slow and burdensome, Congress has increased oversight of the program and recently passed legislation intended to improve the timeliness of the FMS process. For example, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Congress required DOD to revise its acquisition regulations to place new requirements on FMS contracting and to establish a pilot program to seek ways to accelerate contracting and pricing processes for FMS. DSCA officials were uncertain of a new deployment date as system requirements are currently being re-validated and expected to continue through 2020. Our review found that DOD considers a variety of factors when reviewing nonrecurring cost waiver requests, but, ultimately, the department wants to ensure that sales are not jeopardized. Individually and collectively, these sales complement various foreign policy, national security, and economic objectives. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, DOD approved 99 percent of the 813 nonrecurring cost waiver requests for major defense equipment sold through the FMS program. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, DOD approved 99 percent of the 813 nonrecurring cost waiver requests for major defense equipment sold through the FMS program. One waiver request from a foreign government that would have been eligible to use the equipment standardization justification but cited the loss of sale justification in its waiver request. The only waiver requests from a foreign government that would have been eligible to use the equipment standardization justification but cited the loss of sale justification in its waiver request. To select the remaining 19 waivers, we set a threshold for waivers approved where the value of the nonrecurring cost was over $20 million to capture high-value waivers, as these waivers represented 80 percent of the total value of approved waivers within our time frame for our sample selection. Next, we selected at least 2 waiver requests from each fiscal year for the 6-year period included in our review and ensured a mix of waivers requested by various foreign governments, including those that had the highest value of waivers approved. Overall, we found that the documentation for the selected waiver requests generally matched the data DSCA provided. We interviewed DSCA officials responsible for the data to identify the quality controls in place to ensure the data are accurate and reliable. In total, these approved nonrecurring cost waivers amounted to nearly $16 billion. In total, these approved nonrecurring cost waivers amounted to nearly $16 billion",
  "RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers and their families under the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, as amended (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act of 1938, as amended (RUIA). Individuals who work for railroads engaged in interstate commerce, for railroad associations, and for railroad labor organizations are among those covered by RRB’s benefits system instead of Social Security or the federal-state unemployment insurance system. During fiscal year 2016, RRB generally reviews the beneficiary’s continuing eligibility for disability benefits at intervals from 6 months to 18 months. For MIP cases, RRB mails a questionnaire at least once every 3 years that asks a beneficiary to update medical and earnings information. If the self-reported information indicates medical improvement or a return to work, RRB may conduct a CDR. For MINE cases, RRB’s regulations state that it will not routinely review the beneficiary’s continuing eligibility. RRB also collects taxes to cover additional benefits. A financial interchange between the two systems may also affect how and when RRB classifies a beneficiary as MINE, or whether it should schedule (or “diary”) a CDR. RRB may conduct a CDR.

If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7215 or curdae@gao.gov. RRB agreed with all three of the recommendations and noted that it has already taken initial steps to implement them. A financial interchange between the two systems may also affect how and when RRB classifies a beneficiary as MINE, or whether it should schedule (or “diary”) a CDR. RRB maintains a list of scheduled CDRs, as well as the payroll taxes that would have been collected if the railroad workers were covered by Social Security instead of their own system. According to RRB data, the railroad retirement, survivor, and disability system is projected to remain solvent over at least the next 25 years. Under the RRA, RRB provides two distinct disability benefits for railroad workers—total and permanent (T&P) disability and occupational disability. In addition to medical reviews, RRB conducts earnings CDRs for beneficiaries detected with earnings that exceed disability program limits. Most earnings CDRs are triggered by unreported earnings detected through RRB’s policing operation. Policing for earnings involves an annual data match by SSA in According to the data provided by RRB, about 90 percent of individuals who received a disability payment in fiscal year 2016 found the earned income in question ranged from 2011 through 2013. RRB officials acknowledged that the data it currently uses for its policing effort cause delays in identifying earnings. When overpayments are not identified in a timely manner, RRB’s ability to detect when a beneficiary is not eligible for benefits is hindered, thereby increasing the potential for lost federal dollars. More specifically, the manual instructs disability examiners to classify beneficiaries over age 54½ as “medical improvement not expected” because of the remote likelihood that they will be able to engage in medium or heavy work. Scheduled medical CDRs resulted in few terminations and identified few overpayments. Data provided by RRB indicate that of the 43 medical CDRs completed during fiscal years 2014-2016, 3 ineligible beneficiaries were identified and 1 overpayment of $28,000 was identified and calculated. RRB determined that 40 of the 43 beneficiaries (93 percent) continued to meet the appropriate disability criteria for occupational or T&P disability, as applicable, and qualify for benefits. However, according to a RRB official, IRS earnings data are currently the only source to which RRB has access for earnings policing that includes all of its disability beneficiaries. RRB has considered conducting earnings policing using the Department of Health and Human Services’ quarterly earnings data from the National Directory of New Hires, which includes the most recent eight quarters of wages reported from all states. In fiscal years 2017-2019, RRB determined that 40 of the 43 beneficiaries (93 percent) continued to meet the appropriate disability criteria for occupational or T&P disability, as applicable, and qualify for benefits. In fiscal years 2014-2016, RRB received approximately $28, as applicable"
