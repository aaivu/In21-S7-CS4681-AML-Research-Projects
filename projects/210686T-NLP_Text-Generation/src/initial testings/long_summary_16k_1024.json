  "U production would be needed. NNSA and TVA officials noted that other fuel cycle facilities have previously been uninterested in conducting book storage for NNSA, so options may be limited. According to NNSA officials, if book storage was unavailable in the future, NNSA could pay for the physical storage of the LEU. However, this option was not ultimately included in NNSA’s October 2016 mission need statement. This option was not ultimately included in NNSA’s October 2016 mission need statement. Further, the preliminary cost estimates developed by NNSA for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge technology options were limited in scope. The preliminary cost estimates developed by NNSA for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge technology options were limited in scope—sized for a capacity to enrich uranium only for tritium production—and do not reflect the full costs of building a uranium enrichment facility that could eventually meet a range of enriched uranium mission needs. Prior to the use of TVA’s reactor, the United States used other government-owned reactors to produce tritium (see fig. 1). In 1999, TVA signed an interagency agreement with DOE to produce tritium at its Watts Bar and Sequoyah commercial nuclear reactors. Due to degradation of the equipment, the expected rate of equipment failure, a lack of replacement parts, the dispersion of trained and qualified personnel, and ongoing decontamination and demolition activities, a major effort would be required to support tritium production for a number of years. Since 2015, the plant and equipment have significantly deteriorated, and restart of the Paducah GDP is no longer a feasible option, according to NNSA documents and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) representatives. Due to degradation of the equipment, the expected rate of equipment failure, a lack of replacement parts, the dispersion of trained and qualified personnel, and ongoing decontamination and demolition activities, a major effort would be required to support tritium production for a number of years, according to NNSA’s technical evaluation and the 2015 plan.

NNSA’s preliminary estimates for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge are limited in scope, and the estimate for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge are limited in scope, according to NNSA officials and ORNL representatives. NNSA officials also stated that there will be challenges in establishing a U.S. manufacturing base of suppliers for the small The following is a summary of our assessments. Comprehensive. Best practices state that—to be considered comprehensive—a cost estimate should include both government and contractor costs of the project over its full life cycle, from “cradle to grave.” This includes costs from the inception of the project through design, development, deployment, and operation and maintenance, to retirement of the project. According to NNSA and State Department officials, longstanding U.S. policy will likely preclude the use of these options. The mission need statement indicates a preference for using enriched uranium to continue the tritium production mission, as it only identifies options to obtain additional enriched uranium. The mission need statement indicates a preference for using enriched uranium to continue the tritium production mission, as it only identifies options to obtain additional enriched uranium. This approach would exclude consideration of certain technology options, such as one that may have the potential to produce tritium without the need for enriched uranium. According to a senior DOE official, though DOE has discontinued the majority of its funding, the department has taken two actions to preserve the large centrifuge technology—preserving the intellectual property for this technology and hiring some former Centrus employees—to ensure that the technology can be deployed if it is selected in the analysis of alternatives. Further, under NNSA’s timeline for a domestic uranium enrichment capability, it could take until 2027 to begin construction of a uranium enrichment plant. We found that the cost estimate to build a large centrifuge facility partially met the comprehensive characteristic because it included a high-level description of the work to be performed, and presented a brief summary description of the schedule, number of machines, and activities. However, the estimate was not a life cycle cost estimate because it excluded certain costs, and",
  "-lowering modification, and, according to FHA officials, some modifications could increase monthly payments for borrowers with a large number of missed payments. Likewise, borrowers could lose access to benefits such as reevaluation for the suite of FHA loss mitigation options. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications offered by purchasers. FHA may not be required to sell loan assets if a serious conflict exists between selling loans and policy goals. FHA officials told us that it also has absolute discretion to exclude one or more loans from the sale. According to FHA officials told us that FHA has two different provisions in place to correct when a loan should not have been sold. While we considered classifying loans reported as resold as performing, our review of status sequences for loans with at least one resold status showed that purchasers reported a range of nonperforming outcomes before and after the resold status. Additionally, about 22 percent of the modifications offered to borrowers whose loans were sold in the 2015 sale and later included a deferment. These rates generally exceeded the foreclosure and short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure estimates for similar, unsold loans (34 and about 9 percent, respectively). Purchasers told us that the outcome they pursue for a loan depends in part on the borrower’s preference. If the highest bid was at least $5,054,000, the MMI Fund may not be negatively affected by the sale. The piecewise model estimated that the best option is to try to modify the loan and achieve reperformance status. These rates generally exceeded the foreclosure and short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure estimates for similar, unsold loans. This generally results in a greater loss to the MMI Fund. In the case of a DASP sale, FHA pays a claim to the servicer in the amount of the unpaid mortgage balance and other expenses. In addition, for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure, our calculated reserve price was 25 percent or more below the winning bid. When FHA described its process for evaluating program changes, FHA also described the use and reliability of these data sets in the sections that follow this table. We attempted to minimize differences between the sold and unsold loans by matching loans across several variables that could affect the likelihood of foreclosure or foreclosure. In the case of a DASP sale, FHA avoids interest and servicing costs during the foreclosure period as well as REO-related expenses, but incurs the cost of the difference between the unpaid balance and other expenses. FHA also experienced another period when no sales were conducted between 2005 and 2009. Federal internal control standards require that management implement control activities through policies. This includes documenting in policies the internal control responsibilities of the organization and periodically reviewing policies, procedures, When HUD extended the prohibition against foreclosure from 6 months to 12 months in 2015, for instance, a HUD press release stated that such changes “not only strengthen the program but help to ensure it continues to serve its intended purposes of supporting the MMI Fund and offering borrowers a second chance at avoiding foreclosure.” And when HUD changed DASP in 2016 to prohibit purchasers from abandoning low- value loans prior to being modified to their monthly payments after being modified. We did not independently verify the data in the FHFA reports, but we interviewed the FHFA staff that generated the report about the reliability of the data. Some limitations stem from the differences between FHA’s and the enterprises’ pools and the underlying loans. FHA has additional regulatory requirements, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales. We limited our review of participants and characteristics to the loans included in our comparison analysis of outcomes to provide descriptive context for this analysis. To assess the reliability of the data sources above, we reviewed all loans sold in DASP sales that occurred between 2013 and 2016, with some exceptions, in line with the scope of our comparison analysis of outcomes. We selected this scope because it represented the period for which FHA was generally able to provide consistent postsale quarterly reports. We found that less than 0.1 percent of the sold loans in our scope were not reported as delinquent by servicers and determined that, due to their small percentage, excluding these loans would not bias our results. In addition, FHA may not collect the data it needs to evaluate whether modifications offered by purchasers remain sustainable. Nonetheless, FHA received similar numbers of bids and bid amounts relative to the estimated property values as the enterprises. However, the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of the",

Absent applications or verified losses, Puerto Rico assumed that nonapplicants and applicants without verified losses had some level of unmet needs. Puerto Rico estimated these potential unmet needs to be approximately $5.8 billion. To estimate unmet needs, HUD then multiplied the number of units it identified as having major-low, major-high, and severe damage to account for owners and renters that did not apply to FEMA and FEMA applicants without verified losses. HUD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We considered three comments to be more than technical in nature. HUD concurred with our recommendation and has since updated its policies and procedures to require that nonapplicants and applicants without verified losses. Puerto Rico estimated these potential unmet needs to be approximately $5.8 billion. HUD officials told us that there were a significant number of FEMA applicants who were denied in Puerto Rico due to an inability to prove property ownership. However, the draft report identified grantee capacity as an administrative challenge that CDBG-DR grantees face that is not related to the lack of permanent statutory authority. The HUD OIG also has conducted numerous audits of the internal controls of prior CDBG-DR funds. This is because HUD’s estimate of unmet needs was used to allocate funds to grantees and grantees’ estimates were used to target their funding. HUD also noted that there was more than one way to determine unmet needs and that it was acceptable for grantees to use different methodologies to reflect their local circumstances. According to HUD officials, all four grantees had entered into grant agreements with HUD for their initial 2017 CDBG-DR funds. As of January 2019, all four grantees had entered into grant agreements with HUD for their initial 2017 CDBG-DR funds. In written feedback that HUD provided to the grantee on its capacity assessment, the HUD reviewer asked for more comprehensive analysis of staffing needs and to include a rationale for the number of staff to be assigned to each function. Yet, other feedback HUD provided focused on whether certain information was included rather than on the quality of the information. For example, when reviewing the grantee’s financial processes and procedures, the reviewer pointed out that the grantee had not shown that it had addressed prior audit findings. In another instance, the reviewer asked the grantee to include additional information in the section of its action plan on unmet needs, but did not focus on the grantee’s methodology. According to a HUD official, this documentation was not readily available for each grantee because it is not part of the official administrative record. Even if readily available, such documentation likely would not substantiate HUD’s conclusions that grantees’ submissions and estimates were sufficient. CPD’s monitoring handbook states that staff must document the basis for their conclusions during a monitoring review because “monitoring conclusions must be clear to persons unfamiliar with the participant, program, or technical area.” According to a HUD official, this documentation was not readily available for each grantee because it is not part of the official administrative record.

After 1999, CSPF’s investment policy under other, successive named fiduciaries continued to be broad and generally specified that the plan should invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities. Specifically J.P. Morgan’s and Northern Trust’s consecutive investment policies for part of the plan’s assets continued to specify that a majority of the plan’s assets be invested in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 15 percent be invested in nonpublicly traded assets. CSPF’s investment policy under other, successive named fiduciaries continued to be broad and generally specified that the plan should invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 15 percent be invested in nonpublicly traded assets.

CSPF trustees said that named fiduciaries considered investing in alternative assets, but instead chose to increase the plan’s allocation to equity assets. We also ran another calculation that did not include “other” income so we could estimate the impact of not adjusting for such information. The U.S. Department of the Treasury provided no comments. We will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and other interested parties. This report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. In 2015, the plan’s actuary certified that the plan was in “critical and declining” status. Multiemployer plan trust funds can be allocated among many different types of assets, any of which can generally be passively- or actively-managed, domestically or internationally based, or publicly or nonpublicly traded (see table 1). A plan’s funded percentage is its ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities. We calculated the dollar-weighted average return, calculated as a geometric average of the annual returns over the period. The dollar-weighted average return is the rate that, when applied over time to a variety of economic and demographic factors, including the potential volatility of asset values, estimates of a plan’s funded percentage may vary from year to year. Defined benefit pension plans Treasury, specifically the IRS, is charged with determining whether a private sector pension plan qualifies for preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the IRS is generally responsible for enforcing ERISA’s minimum funding requirements, among other things. The consent decree defines roles and responsibilities for its parties, including the court, the court-appointed independent special counsel, DOL, the plan and its Board of Trustees, and the independent asset manager, which is called the named fiduciary. The primary role of the court is to oversee and enforce the consent decree. Specifically, to ensure we captured the vast majority of the assets in CSPF and the plan’s demographics—such as an older population and fewer employers—in its decision to withdraw. CSPF officials said they did not want UPS to withdraw because its annual contributions accounted for about one-third of all contributions to the plan. CSPF officials also told us that, prior to the UPS withdrawal, they had expected the population of active UPS workers in CSPF to grow over time. In our prior work, we reported that multiemployer plans generally develop an assumed average rate of investment return and use that assumption to determine funding targets, required contributions, and the potential cost of benefit improvements. We did not identify an alternative asset category in CSPF’s asset reports for 2016, but the TUCS comparator group median asset allocation in that year is 11.8 percent of assets. Similar to our findings when comparing the returns on CSPF’s investments to a customized peer group of other large institutional funds, the annual returns on CSPF’s investments in recent decades have also generally been in line with the annual returns of similar multiemployer pension plans.

  " level for the LCR. EPA has efforts underway to reconsider the action level for the LCR. EPA has efforts underway to reconsider the action level for the LCR, which may include a change in the action level from one that is based on technical feasibility, to one that also considers lead exposure in vulnerable populations such as infants and young children, which EPA refers to as a health-based benchmark. In 1988, the SDWA was amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA), which banned the manufacture and sale of drinking water coolers with lead-lined tanks containing more than 8 percent lead; the statute defined a drinking water cooler as containing 8 percent lead or less as “lead-free.” The LCCA also required states to establish testing and remediation programs for schools. The LCCA also required states to establish testing and remediation programs for schools. However, in 1996 a federal circuit court held that this requirement was unconstitutional. In 2011, Congress passed the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, which amended the SDWA by lowering the maximum allowable lead content in “lead-free” plumbing materials such as pipes. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead in school drinking water. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program to support school district efforts to test for and remediation of lead in school drinking water. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead contamination in drinking water at schools. We interviewed representatives with the University of Massachusetts, because of their role in implementing the state’s program to support school district efforts to test for and remediate lead in school drinking water. As a condition of receiving funds, school districts are required to test for lead using standards that are at least as stringent as those in federal guidance for schools. In March 2018, Congress appropriated $20 million to EPA for this grant program. Lead can enter drinking water when service lines or plumbing fixtures that contain lead corrode, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content. According to EPA, responsibility for water management may be held by individuals in different positions, such as facilities managers or environmental specialists. Lead is a neurotoxin that can accumulate in the body over time with long- lasting effects, particularly for children. According to the CDC, lead in school drinking water during the past 12 months varied substantially, depending on the number of schools in which a district took action to remediate lead (see table 3). The median expenditure for school districts taking action in one to four schools was $4,000 compared to a median expenditure for school districts taking action in 51 or more schools of $278,000. EPA regional officials provided examples of eight states that have requirements for schools to test for lead in school drinking water as EPA has made further efforts to communicate the importance of lead testing to schools to help ensure that their lead testing programs are in line with good practices included in the 3Ts guidance. EPA has made further efforts to communicate the importance of lead testing to schools to help ensure that their lead testing programs are in line with good practices included in the 3Ts guidance. We also evaluated federal efforts against the Memorandum of Understanding, in which EPA, Education, and CDC agreed to encourage testing drinking water for lead and communicate with key stakeholders, among other things. To inform all of our research objectives, we interviewed representatives with the National Conference of State Legislatures, National Center for Healthy Housing, National Alliance of Public Charter Schools, the DC Public Charter School Board, and the 21st Century School Fund. We identified a range of approaches to communicating testing efforts in the 17 school districts we interviewed. Some school districts reported issuing press releases, putting letters in multiple languages in students’ backpacks, sending emails to parents, holding public meetings, and releasing information through social media. Although the guidance recommends that school districts prioritize taking action if lead levels from water fountains and other outlets used for consumption exceed 20 ppb (based on a 250 milliliter water sample), EPA officials told us when the guidance was originally developed in response to the 1988 LCCA requirement, the agency did not have information available to recommend an action level specifically designed for schools. Furthermore, EPA officials told us that the action level in the 3Ts guidance is not a health-based standard. However, there are statements in the guidance that appear to suggest otherwise. For a more detailed discussion of our survey methodology, see appendix I. The survey was comprised of closed- and open-ended questions. In this appendix, we",
  ", that the Select Agent Program did not consistently report violations of the Select Agent Program’s policies and procedures. The Select Agent Program did not consistently refer laboratories to investigative entities for violations of the select agent regulations or enforce regulations related to incidents involving incomplete inactivation. According to agency reports and inspectors we spoke with, inspectors often travel 30 percent to 50 percent or more of their time in performing their duties. This intensive workload and travel schedule has led to delays in both the issuing of inspection reports and processing of registration amendments. According to a 2017 CDC report, the CDC and APHIS components of the Select Agent Program manage fragmentation by collaborating on many aspects of the program, such as through maintaining frequent communication at the director level. They also said that the program had not developed a joint mission statement or strategic planning tools in the past because they prioritized other efforts in the past because they prioritized other efforts in recent years, including responding to incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2015, addressing recommendations from recent reports, and developing a new database for the Select Agent Program.

The Select Agent Program does not fully meet our key elements of effective oversight. Specifically, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program does not have joint strategic planning documents to guide its oversight efforts, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan; it did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan and workforce plan; it did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan over the course of our review.

Specifically, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program regularly performs reviews of laboratories’ compliance with regulatory and program requirements, but these reviews may not target the activities that pose the highest risk to biological safety and security. Most laboratories registered with the Select Agent Program are registered with CDC (238 of 276). (See fig. 1 for information about the laboratories registered with the program.) In fiscal year 2016, CDC’s budget to manage its component of the Select Agent Program was about $21 million and APHIS’s was about $5.5 million. Select agent regulations govern the possession, use, and transfer of designated select agents. To apply for a certificate of registration, the laboratory is required to report violations of the Select Agent Program’s policies and procedures. CDC and APHIS also held a workshop for responsible officials from registered laboratories in December 2016 to disseminate program information; the workshop also provided the opportunity for attendees to interact. Many laboratory representatives told us that this was very helpful, and some noted that they had not had an opportunity to communicate and share lessons learned with responsible officials from other registered laboratories in the past. Some other regulatory sectors in the United States are also structurally independent from regulated laboratories as a mechanism to ensure independence. For example, prior to the creation of NRC in 1974, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was responsible for both promotion and oversight of the nuclear industry. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 established NRC as a separate, independent entity. According to a relevant Senate committee report, this was a response to growing criticism that there was a basic conflict between the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission’s regulation of the nuclear power industry and its development and promotion of new technology for the industry. In addition, once initial risks are identified, it is important for agencies to regularly re-examine risks to identify new risks or changes to existing risks. In addition, federal internal control standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. According to CDC’s Circular A-123 requires federal agencies to integrate risk management activities into their program management to help ensure they are effectively managing risks that could affect the achievement of agency objectives. According to the circular, once initial risks are identified, it is important for agencies to regularly re-examine risks to identify new risks or changes to existing risks. In addition, federal internal control standards state that management should explore options to improve independence, including reexamining previous reviews and assessing the need to address gaps in the",

Key federal entities, including Interior and CEQ, have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the San Francisco Bay Delta watershed. Different combinations of federal and nonfederal entities have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the Bay Delta watershed. Different combinations of federal and nonfederal entities work throughout the watershed and its three major geographic areas, which are the San Francisco Bay and its local watershed (Bay), the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), and the upper watershed, which includes California’s Central Valley and the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. See below for a list of federal and nonfederal entities and a brief description of some of their restoration-related roles in the Bay Delta watershed. In the state level, the San Francisco Estuary Institute and the Delta Stewardship Council each maintains a database with information about federal and nonfederal restoration efforts. These plans include goals similar to those outlined in the CCMP or the Delta Plan—such as ecosystem restoration, climate resilience, and other facilities. Several federal agencies have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the Bay-Delta watershed. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities carry out a wide range of restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities carry out a wide range of restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities provide input on developing and revising the CCMP and have integrated goals into the CCMP from their own topic- or entity-specific strategic plans. In addition, since California stopped participating in the originally structured CALFED partnership, funding for ecosystem restoration in the Bay area traditionally has come from a mix of federal and state sources. For example, the entity said a local source that will provide nearly $500 (Recommendation 7) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to CEQ, EPA, OMB, and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, and the Interior. We also provided the California Delta Stewardship Council a draft of this report for review and comment. Dredging businesses. Dredging businesses work with the California State Water Resources Control Board to help fund the San Francisco Estuary Institute’s water quality monitoring program. Water contractors. Dredging businesses work with the California State Water Resources Control Board to help fund the San Francisco Estuary Institute’s water quality monitoring program. Water contractors. In an email from CEQ’s Deputy General Counsel, CEQ provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. In oral comments provided on August 8, 2018, OMB staff suggested some additional language to the report. In oral comments provided on August 8, 2018, OMB staff suggested that OMB should “assess whether to” update OMB’s written guidance for federal and state agencies on submitting data for the budget crosscut reports. Also, according to our analysis of survey responses, 27 of 48 federal and nonfederal entities indicated that it would be very or extremely important to have reports on federal obligations, and 24 of the 48 entities indicated that it would be very or extremely important to have reports on state obligations. The San Francisco Bay Delta Conservation and Development Commission. The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission plans, collaborates on, and regulates the San Francisco Bay, Bay shoreline, and Suisun Marsh; it also permits projects that fill or extract materials from the Bay. According to the record of decision, CALFED’s water quality goal was to provide good water quality for the millions of Californians who rely on the Delta for all or a part of their",
  "s investments, or releases of larger projects. For example, the Defense investment in our sample was the seventh increment of an ongoing investment; Energy’s system was the first of two phases; the DHS investment was rolled out to two locations prior to deployment to 37 additional locations; and Transportation’s investment had been part of a prototype deployed to four airports. Common factors critical to the success of three or more of the seven investments were: 1. Program officials were actively engaged with stakeholders. 2. Program staff had the necessary knowledge and skills. 3. Senior department and agency executives supported the programs. 4. End users and stakeholders were involved in the development of requirements. 5. End users participated in testing system functionality prior to formal end-user acceptance testing. 6. Government and contractor staff were stable and consistent. 7. Program officials had the necessary knowledge and skills. 8. Programs received sufficient funding. These critical factors help support OMB’s objective of improving the management of large-scale IT investments. As a result, the agency reported that it intends to update its policies and process for CIO certification of adequate incremental development and described planned actions to implement it. As a result, the agency’s policy and process for CIO certification of adequate development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies increase the risk that the potential impact of utilizing incremental development to more quickly deliver useful functionality to users and improve the likelihood that these multimillion dollar projects will meet their stated goals, may not be realized. As a result, the officials in the GSA Office of the CIO stated that they are enabling the business customers to serve as better product owners. In May 2014, we reported that, by implementing this change, project staffs have (1) defined and prioritized clearer requirements; (2) selected the proper technical tools to support business needs; and in some cases, the proposed dates for completion have changed several times. In addition, several policies were still being developed. Therefore, we cannot be assured that these documents will fully address the areas we noted in this report. OMB’s fiscal year 2017 CIO certification policies are not consistent with OMB’s CIO certification policies. OMB staff reported that development work was slowed by inefficient governance and oversight processes; 5 agencies reported that development schedules were impeded by procurement delays; 5 agencies identified the lack of funding as their top challenge; 5 agencies identified the lack of stable, prioritized requirements as a challenge. In addition, 3 agencies identified a new challenge which had not been described in our prior work. One approach to reducing software development risks is to divide investments into smaller parts, or increments. While a traditional waterfall software development effort usually is broadly scoped, incremental development is a more complex process. One approach to reducing software development risks is to reduce software development risks. One approach to reducing software development risks is to reduce software development risks. In addition, GSA officials stated that they had experienced delays in meeting their incremental projects’ delivery schedules due to dependencies on multiple complex projects. These officials told us that the agency addressed these delays by improving existing processes and implementing a change control board and an enterprise test development environment. SBA officials reported that delays were introduced when the agency did not have necessary software and hardware available for development activities. Officials noted that these challenges were a result of the agency not maintaining an updated inventory of approved software and developers not having access to laptops needed for development activities. Officials noted that these challenges were a result of the agency not maintaining an updated inventory of approved software and developers not having access to laptops needed for development activities. SBA officials stated that the agency addressed the lack of approved software and equipment needed for incremental development by processing a waiver to use software tools and procuring laptops needed for development activities. Incremental development work was slowed by inefficient governance and oversight processes. Officials from the Office of the CIO at five agencies (Education, HUD, Interior, OPM, and USDA) reported that, while progress has been made in addressing this high-risk area, significant work remains to be completed. For example, as of December 2016, OMB and agencies had implemented 366 (or about 46 percent) of the 803 open recommendations that we had made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015 related to IT acquisitions and operations. As of August 2017, none of the agencies had taken action to address the recommendation; as discussed later in the report. We issued an update to our high-risk report in February 2017 and noted that, while progress has been made in addressing this high-risk area, significant work remains to be completed. For example, as of December 2016",

In response, in web pages for the 20 targets available in June 2018, the Study had established intermediate targets for an additional 10 of the 18 long-term targets that did not have intermediate targets. In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets that did not have intermediate targets. In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets that did not have intermediate targets. In these 10 targets, the Study identified how much progress would need to be made each year to achieve each target’s numerical goal by 2035. The TMDL also calls for implementing management actions for nitrogen entering the Sound from other states where feasible. In the TMDL, Connecticut and New York identified the need for an adaptive management approach because it would require nitrogen reduction beyond the limits of technology current at the time. The states also agreed to reassess the nitrogen reduction goals and revise the TMDL. In a letter signed by the Regional Administrators of EPA Region 1 and Region 2, EPA stated that the report is timely because the Study is working to transition from the 1994 plan to evaluating and reporting on the 2015 plan and highlighted steps the agency will take to meet our recommendations. The 2015 plan has four goals, associated with four themes: clean water and healthy watersheds. Clean water and healthy watersheds. The goal associated with four themes are as follows. Clean water and healthy watersheds. In the TMDL, Connecticut and New York identified the need for an adaptive management approach because it would require nitrogen reduction beyond the limits of technology current at the time. The states also agreed to reassess the nitrogen reduction goals and revise the TMDL as necessary. In a letter signed by the Regional Administrators of EPA Region 1 and Region 2, EPA stated that the Study only assigned 75 percent of the 139 implementation actions in the 2015 plan to these four ranges. Instead of a cost range, the Study identified the funding needs for more than This appendix provides information on the scope of work and the methodology used to examine (1) what is known about the progress made toward achieving the 1994 Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (1994 plan); (2) the goals of the 2015 plan; (3) the goals of the 2015 plan; and (4) the goals of the 2015 plan; and (5) the factors that may hinder progress toward the goals of the 2015 plan. In our review of the 2015 plan is the Mussel Watch program, run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science. The Study reported that increasing the number of public access points may be difficult because there are many privately owned properties along the Long Island Sound coast. We did not identify any factors that may hinder progress toward the goals. We did not identify any factors that may hinder progress toward the goals. The 2015 plan defines outcomes as “broad results needed to achieve the goals.” For example, as shown in table 4, an outcome associated with the “clean water and healthy watersheds” theme is “to improve research, monitoring, and modeling for water quality.” Each outcome has multiple associated objectives, which are the accomplishments needed to achieve each outcome, and each objective has multiple strategies. By working with the Study as it finalizes its reporting format to incorporate the leading practices of performance reporting, EPA could help ensure that the Study provides the public and Congress with the information they need to determine whether the Study is making progress toward achieving the long-term targets associated with the goals of the 2015 plan, or whether the Study should take additional action to meet the targets. Study members estimated in the 2015 plan that future restoration activities would cost at least $18.9 billion over 20 years. Nearly all the amount was for activities addressing the goal to achieve clean waters and healthy watersheds."
