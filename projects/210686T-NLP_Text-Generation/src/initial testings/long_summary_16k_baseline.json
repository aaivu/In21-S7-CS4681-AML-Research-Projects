According to NNSA documents, NNSA is still developing the technology and intend to create a new cost estimate.

NNSA’s program to develop LEU to be developed by NNSA, and NNSA’s program to develop LEU to be developed by NNSA, according to NNSA documents. According to NNSA documents, NNSA has preliminarily identified the two remaining uranium enrichment technologies as the most feasible options to supply unobligated LEU, which is subject to a peaceful use provision in an international agreement between the United States and Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. According to NNSA documents, the cost estimates are preliminary and are intended only to be developed by NNSA, and NNSA is developing more in-depth cost estimates as NNSA progresses further in the analysis of LEU and LEU. According to NNSA documents, NNSA may be missing opportunities to consider options for providing additional enriched uranium that do not entail reestablishing a uranium enrichment plant. According to NNSA documents, and we identified one additional risk, facing the DBOT program. According to NNSA’s October 2015 plan identified the uncertainty of annual appropriations in the amount of $770 million to support this program. According to NNSA’s October 2015 plan identified a second risk associated with the availability of material for the program. The second most feasible option to supply unobligated LEU for tritium production is the design for a small centrifuge technology. NNSA has adhered to this policy and used only unobligated LEU and the dates when it will be available are subject to some uncertainty. According to a September 2015 DOE memorandum, the department had obtained the testing data it needed and determined that there was “minimal incremental value” in the United States. There is",

In a May 2018 report, the HUD OIG stated that the grantees had developed a staffing plan to address long-term oversight and management of the CDBG-DR program and, as of March 1, 2019, expected to fill 14 positions over the next 3 months. In addition, the HUD OIG recommended that HUD continue to fill its vacancies and assess staffing resources as it prepared for additional disaster funds. HUD also stated that grantees have the discretion to use allocated funds to assist applicants with less severe damage as long as those individuals have unmet needs. As a result, the final report is a good first step, HUD still needs to conduct workforce planning to determine if the number of staff they will be able to hire is sufficient to oversee the growing number of CDBG-DR grants. As discussed above, HUD officials told us that HUD officials did not address all key requirements for CDBG-DR grants, but in the absence of additional guidance for staff, it was unclear how they determine that documents are adequate. In addition, in a May 2018 report on CDBG-DR program would allow HUD to assess the grantees’s requirements for CDBG-",

In addition, the program has begun to take steps towards development of a joint workforce plan that assesses workforce and training needs, such as in cases where the inspectors are not familiar with certain techniques or equipment being used in a registered laboratory. However, the program has not developed a joint mission statement or strategic planning tools in the past, which, according to officials, which, in order to allow",
