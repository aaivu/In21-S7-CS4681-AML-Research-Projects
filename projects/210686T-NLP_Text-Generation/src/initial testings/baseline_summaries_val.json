  "Part of the Mariana Islands Archipelago, the CNMI is a chain of 14 islands in the western Pacific Ocean, just north of Guam and about 3,200 miles west of Hawaii. The CNMI has a total population of 53,890, according to the CNMI’s 2016 Household, Income, and Expenditures Survey. Almost 90 percent of the population (48,200) resided on the island of Saipan, with an additional 6 percent (3,056) on the island of Tinian and 5 percent (2,635) on the island of Rota. The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS exercises parole authority to allow, on a case-by-case basis, eligible nationals of China to enter the CNMI temporarily as tourists when there is significant public benefit, according to DHS. Following consecutive annual decreases in the total number of employed workers from 2005 through 2013, employment has increased annually since 2014, according to CNMI tax data. Figure 4 shows the numbers of employed workers, both foreign and domestic, in the CNMI from 2001 through 2016. From 2013 to 2016, the number of employed workers increased by approximately 25 percent, from 23,344 to 29,215. As figure 4 shows, while the number and percentage of foreign workers fell between 2001 and 2016, foreign workers still constitute the majority of the CNMI workforce. Of the nearly 30,000 employed workers in the CNMI in 2016, more than half were foreign workers, according to CNMI tax data. The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the number of CW-1 permits almost doubled, and since fiscal year 2016, the number of permits has approached the numerical limits on permits for those years. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the number of permits approved for workers born in the Philippines, who received the most permits for all 7 years of the CW program, had declined by 13 percent from fiscal year 2012 to more than 13,000 in fiscal year 2016. Under the terms of S. 2325, the number of permits issued may not exceed 13,000 during fiscal year 2017. Starting in fiscal year 2020, the number of permits issued may not exceed a number that is 500 fewer than the number issued during the immediately preceding fiscal year. Figure 1 shows the past and future numerical limits on CNMI-Only Transitional Worker permits established by DHS and the proposed numerical limits for permits under S. 2325. The limits shown for S. 2325 in figure 1 assume that employers would petition for, and DHS would issue, the maximum number of available permits for fiscal year 2019 and for each subsequent year. Under S. 2325, as of January 26, 2018, fiscal year 2018 petitions were still being adjudicated. Our preliminary analysis of USCIS CW-1 permit data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 identified trends in CW-1 workers’ country of birth, occupation, and duration of employment. USCIS data showed a decline in the numbers of CW-1 permits for fiscal years 2017 through 2018 for workers born in each of the five countries listed most frequently on the petitions—the Philippines, China, South Korea, Bangladesh, and Japan (see table 3). As of January 17, 2018, the number of permits approved for workers born in the Philippines, who received the most permits for all 7 years of the CW program, had declined by 13 percent from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018 and by 26 percent from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018. Concurrent with construction of the casino and other tourism infrastructure, the number of CW-1 permits for workers born in China increased by almost 3,800 from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016 and declined by about 3,500 from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018. Table 2 shows the CW-3 permits could be renewed in 3-year increments during the transition period for workers who remain outside the United States",
  ". GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. PHMSA officials also told us that intrastate pipelines pose the highest safety risk to states and, consequently, state pipeline safety agencies should focus their efforts on intrastate pipeline oversight rather than participating in interstate pipeline inspections. During the last 7 years, four states that applied for an agent agreement— New Hampshire, Virginia, Maryland, and Nevada—were not accepted by PHMSA for these reasons. (See app. I.) In 2013, PHMSA decided not to renew another state pipeline safety agency’s interstate agent agreement, citing the state agency’s inability to staff its program properly, among other things. While temporary interstate agreements provide an opportunity to participate in interstate pipeline oversight, PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agents to develop an annual inspection plan. Unlike the previous analysis, PHMSA’s interstate pipeline safety agency is responsible for conducting interstate pipeline inspections. In addition, PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agencies to develop an annual inspection plan. Unlike the previous analysis, the regional workload analysis takes into account federal inspector workload, pipeline construction, and the amount of pipeline inspections. PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agencies to develop an annual inspection plan. In addition, PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agencies to develop an annual inspection plan. At the federal level, PHMSA is responsible for developing regulations for domestic interstate and intrastate pipeline inspections. In the event PHMSA requested assistance with certain interstate inspections, state inspectors may be unfamiliar with the interstate pipeline systems and operators. As a result, some state officials said that their inspectors may have a steep learning curve when conducting inspections under a temporary interstate agreement. Instead, PHMSA’s regional offices and states are responsible for inspecting nearly 3,000 companies that operate 2.7 million miles of pipelines. Each year, PHMSA uses its Risk Ranking Index Model (RRIM) as one input to determine its annual inspection priorities. While PHMSA has improved how it allocates its current inspection staff among the regions, the agency lacks a forward-looking workforce plan for interstate pipeline inspections. During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. Some violations, including the four illustrative examples below, were deemed serious enough that PHMSA imposed civil penalties. In 2015, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state. During the inspection, Connecticut inspectors found the pipeline operator had failed to employ properly qualified welders in constructing a section of the pipeline. As a result, PHMSA issued a civil penalty of $26,200 to the pipeline operator. In 2016, PHMSA offered to enter into a longer-term, temporary interstate agreement, which would permit the state agency to inspect the installation of two large interstate pipeline systems. The state agency accepted the temporary interstate agreement, which may be extended annually until the completion of the pipeline construction. In 2014, the New York Department of Public Service’s Pipeline Division inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state. During that inspection, New York inspectors identified violations related to the operator’s corrosion-control practices. Inspectors also found that the operator failed to prepare, and follow, a manual for conducting operations and maintenance activities, as well as for emergency response. As a result, PHMSA issued a civil penalty of $61,900. In response to the findings, the operator took action to address the corrosion control-related violations and revised its operations and maintenance manual. In 2011, the New York Department of Public Service’s Pipeline Division inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state. During that inspection, a New York inspector identified violations related to corrosion-control practices. As a result, PHMSA agreed with the recommendation and the state has no plans to reapply. Nevada: Nevada’s pipeline safety agency applied for interstate agent status in 2011. According to state pipeline safety officials, these agencies assume inspection responsibilities for the range of interstate inspection activities, as agreed upon by PHMSA and prioritized by PHMSA during the agency’s annual inspection planning process. States may also propose and conduct additional inspections as they believe necessary. While state inspectors can identify violations, PHMSA is ultimately responsible for enforcement of interstate pipeline regulations and uses a range of enforcement tools from Warning Letters to more stringent Notices of Probable Violation with either proposed compliance orders or proposed civil penalties. Temporary interstate agreement: These agreements allow PHMSA to request a state that has had its certification validated by PHMSA to perform interstate pipeline inspections on a temporary basis. According to PHMSA guidelines, these agreements are used typically for new construction inspections, but may include assistance such as inspection of specific operators, witness to repairs or testing, or investigation of incidents. Since 2010, PHMSA has entered into temporary interstate agreements. Since 2010, PHMSA has entered into",
  "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program, including costs for development, operation and maintenance, and payroll for government employees over the 3 fiscal years. VA’s goal is for all instances of VistA being used in its medical facilities to be standardized where practical. Such standardization is intended to better position the department to switch to the Cerner system. To increase standardization, the VistA Evolution program has been focused over the last 5 years on standardizing a core set of VistA modules related to interoperability which, according to the department, accounts for about 60 percent of VistA. The plans are to be reviewed during the milestone reviews identified in the department’s formal project management framework. In addition, the program has focused on identifying software that is common to each VistA instance. VA refers to this collection of standard software as the gold instance. As part of its effort to standardize VistA, VA has implemented a process to compare the system at each site with the gold instance. Sites that are identified as having variations from the gold instance must apply for a waiver to gain approval for continuing to operate a non-standard VistA instance. These factors remain relevant today and can serve as a model of best practices that VA could apply to enhance the likelihood that the acquisition of a new electronic health record system will be successfully achieved. Among the agencies’ seven IT investments, agency officials identified nine factors as having been critical to the success of three or more of the seven investments. These nine critical success factors are consistent with leading industry practices for IT acquisition. The factors are: Active engagement of senior officials with stakeholders. Qualified and experienced program staff. Support of senior department and agency executives. Involvement of senior department and agency executives. Involvement of end users and stakeholders in the development of requirements. Participation of end users in testing system functionality prior to formal end user acceptance testing. Consistency and stability of government and contractor staff. Prioritization of requirements by program staff. Prioritization of requirements by program staff. Prioritization of requirements by program staff. In the absence of a complete definition of VistA, VistA modules are comprised of one or more software applications that support various health care functions, such as providing care coordination and mental health services. In addition to VistA, the department has taken a number of steps to define the system’s scope and identify the components that the Cerner system will replace. These steps have included conducting two analyses, performing preliminary site assessments, and planning for Cerner to perform a detailed assessment of each site where the new system will be deployed. In addition, officials from two investments noted that actively engaging with stakeholders created transparency and trust, and increased the support from the stakeholders. Additionally, officials for six of the seven selected investments indicated that the knowledge and skills of the program staff were critical to the success of the program. This included knowledge of acquisitions and procurement processes, monitoring of contracts, large-scale organizational transformation, Agile software development concepts, and areas of program management such as earned value management and technical monitoring. Finally, officials for five of the seven selected investments identified having the end users test and validate the system components prior to formal end user acceptance testing for deployment as critical to the success of their program. In addition, to support the program office, the department has awarded a contract for project management support and has also reassigned a number of VA staff to the PEO. Further, VA has drafted a memorandum that describes the role of governance bodies within VA, as well as governance intended to facilitate coordination between DOD and VA. For example, according to the draft memorandum, the department combined data from the VA Systems Inventory, the VistA Document Library, the VA Monograph, and other sources to identify the components that the department will replace. The resulting analysis of VA’s health IT environment identified a total of 330 applications that support health care delivery at a medical center, of which 119 applications (approximately 36 percent) have been identified as having similar functionality as a capability of the Cerner system. Additionally, according to EHRM program documentation, VA is in the process of establishing a Functional Governance Board (FGC) that will be responsible for the implementation of VistA. The FGC will be responsible for the implementation of VistA. The FGC will be responsible for the implementation of VistA. The FGC will",

NASA’s request for a March to June 2019 launch window was driven by its own schedule and technical issues, but also avoids potential conflicts with other mission launches. According to project officials, the delay allows the project to shift some of the work to prepare OTIS for integration with the spacecraft element. When complete, the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The hardware configuration created when the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module were integrated, referred to as OTIS, is expected to arrive at Northrop Grumman months ahead of its need date for integration into the observatory. According to program officials, a workmanship error contributed to the tears. The tears can be repaired; however, some schedule reserve may be required to repair them. Additionally, during the deployment exercise, one of the sunshield’s six membrane tensioning systems experienced a snag. Northrop Grumman reported 496 full-time equivalent staff in September 2017, or 387 more than planned. According to JWST project officials and similar to previous years, Northrop Grumman’s priority for fiscal year 2018 is to maintain schedule in order to reduce risk for challenging environmental tests on flight hardware. These tests allowed the project and its contractors to ensure that the new launch window set from March to June 2019 can be met. As a result, Northrop Grumman’s contractor workforce levels are expected to continue to be elevated through JWST’s final integration and test phase in fiscal year 2019 where the spacecraft and OTIS will be integrated before shipment to the launch site. In these prior reports, we have made recommendations with regard to improving cost and schedule estimating, updating risk assessments, and strengthening management oversight. NASA has generally agreed and taken steps to implement a number of our recommendations. For example, in December 2015, we recommended that the JWST project require contractors to identify, explain, and document anomalies in contractor-delivered monthly earned value management reports. The project has also progressed in preparing the software and ground systems that will operate the observatory and manage and control the telescope’s observations. According to NASA’s Independent Verification and Validation group, the overall status of JWST software development and integration efforts is very positive with minimal development remaining, and the group has significant confidence that the mission software will support the mission objectives. Additionally, the remaining 3.5 months of previously planned schedule reserves was consumed as a result of the contractor having underestimated the time required to complete integration and test work on the spacecraft and other risks identified in the schedule risk analysis. Specifically, execution of spacecraft integration and test tasks, due to the complexity of work and cautious handling given sensitivity of flight hardware, was slower than planned. In December 2016, we reported that the project maintained a risk list with 73 items. Currently, the list of tracked risks has 47 items to be closed or mitigated to acceptable levels. According to Northrop Grumman officials, the sunshield is elevated off the ground for installation work and the size and quantity of the work lifts necessary for the technicians to access the sunshield requires more maneuvering and prevents the technicians from working on the forward and aft sunshield assemblies simultaneously. Taking into account the consumption of planned reserves and the establishment of the revised launch window, the project expected to have up to 4 months of schedule reserve extending to the end of the launch window range, or June 2019. However, shortly after the project notified ESA of the launch delay in September 2017",

The National 911 Program is unable to assess how well its activities are achieving results in relation to its responsibilities identified in the 2012 Act. As the National 911 Program, an NG911 system should have the capability to, among other things: provide a secure environment for emergency communications; acquire and integrate additional data for routing and answering calls; process all types of emergency calls, including multimedia messages; transfer calls with added data to other call centers or first responders. While NG911 systems must possess certain capabilities, it is important to note that states and localities may make decisions about which capabilities they intend to use to achieve NG911 transition. According to NHTSA officials, the cost study will present a nationwide view, rather than a state-by-state view, on the progress of NG911 implementation and its associated costs. This initiative will convene the 911 stakeholder community to identify national-level tasks that need to be completed by federal agencies and other organizations to realize a national, interconnected NG911 system. According to a panel of experts convened by the National 911 Program, a list of proposed rulemaking outlining implementing regulations for the grant program. In a separate effort, an advisory body tasked by FCC to examine 911 call center architecture issued a report in 2016 that provides a cybersecurity self- assessment tool for call centers and guidance on cybersecurity strategies. Description of challenge States may face a range of challenges related to evolving roles for state and local 911 authorities that could hinder NG911 implementation. These technical and operational changes may also have effects on 911 funding and state and local governance structures, which we will discuss in more detail later in this report. According to an FCC advisory body that examined NG911 systems architecture in 2016, while NG911 systems are implemented in a variety of ways at the state or local level, NG911 implementation can occur gradually and in phases. In 2016, the information obtained from our case studies provides examples of broader issues faced by states and localities in managing the NG911 transition. To determine how federal agencies have addressed state and local implementation challenges and planned next steps, we reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and documentation of federal agency actions and plans, and our prior reports. We also interviewed officials from federal agencies, including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), FCC, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), about federal agencies",

In particular, CMS had shown a commitment to combating fraud, in part, by establishing a dedicated entity—the Center for Program Integrity—to lead antifraud efforts, and offering and requiring antifraud training for stakeholder groups, such as providers, beneficiaries, and health-insurance plans; and taken steps to identify fraud risks, such as by designating specific provider types as high risk and developing associated control activities. In January 2016, CMS had not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicaid, and had not designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy. A fraud risk assessment allows managers to fully consider fraud risks to their programs, analyze their likelihood and impact, and prioritize risks. We found that federal spending on Medicaid programs could be reduced by billions of dollars if HHS were required to improve the process for reviewing, approving, and making transparent the basis for spending limits approved for Medicaid demonstrations. In August 2017, we reported that the partnership participants separately told us the HFPP’s studies helped them identify and take action against potentially fraudulent providers and payment vulnerabilities of which they might not otherwise have been aware, and fostered both formal and informal information sharing. As a result, in December 2017 we made three recommendations to CMS, including the need for more complete and accurate reporting, criteria for economical and efficient payments, and written guidance on the distribution of payments. The T-MSIS initiative has the potential to improve CMS’s ability to identify improper payments, help ensure beneficiaries’ access to services, and improve program transparency, among other benefits. As we reported in December 2017, implementing the T-MSIS initiative has been—and will continue to be—a multi-year effort. CMS has worked closely with states and has reached a point where nearly all states are reporting T-MSIS data. As we have previously reported, CMS has made changes to its Medicaid program integrity efforts, including a shift to collaborative audits—in which CMS’s contractors and states work in partnership to audit Medicaid providers. In March 2017, we reported that CMS has identified substantial potential overpayments to providers, but barriers",

We use table 3.3 of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)—State and Local Government Current Receipts and Expenditures—prepared by BEA at the U.S. Department of Commerce as an organizing framework for developing our model of the state and local government sector. For a given year, we used the model to simulate the level of total expenditures that would keep the operating balance greater than or equal to zero. We then calculated the difference between the present value of total expenditures simulated assuming the sector maintains balance, and the present value of real pension benefits paid to state and local governments, and the total present value of state and local government employees’ pension contributions. Then, we calculated the difference between revenues and expenditures assuming the sector maintains current policies, and as a percentage of the present value of U.S. GDP. We calculated all of the present values for the 50-year period from 2018 through 2067, and we used a discount rate equal to the average of the total present value of state and local government employees’ pension contributions, and the value of assets in state and local government defined benefit pension funds in 2017. This suggests that state and local governments may need to take additional steps to manage their pension obligations by reducing benefits or increasing employees’ contributions.

F-22 units are likely to continue to experience aircraft availability and pilot training rates that are below what they could be. F-22 pilots are not meeting their minimum yearly training requirements for the air superiority missions. F-22 pilots need extensive training for F-22 units to fulfill their air superiority role. The Air Force has a comprehensive assessment of the F-22 organizational structure that identifies and assesses alternative approaches to organizing F-22 squadrons. The Air Force also plans to use more durable materials to make long-term corrective repairs beginning in calendar year 2019, but this will constitute a costly long-term effort, according to the Air Force. As a result of the F-22 fleet’s small size and resulting low demand for parts, the Air Force faces a number of supply challenges that have contributed to reduced and unpredictable aircraft availability. The Air Force identified a requirement for 381 F-22s in 2002, but ended aircraft production in 2012 with approximately half of that number. The Air Force identified a number of mission-capable aircraft to this mission, which is more challenging for squadrons with a smaller number of aircraft. The Air Force officials emphasized that the requirements outlined in the Ready Aircrew Program are minimums and noted that some pilots may need additional sorties to achieve proficiency. The total aircraft inventory includes primary mission aircraft in each community—those authorized to perform combat—as well as aircraft that are designated for other purposes. The operational portion of the F-22 fleet is organized into 6 operational squadrons at four locations. According to Air Force officials, the small number of F-22s provides a less than ideal fifth generation fighter capacity until F-35 numbers grow. However, in a June 2017 report to Congress, the Air Force stated that it would not make economic or operational sense to reopen the F-22 production line, and reported that it would cost approximately $50 billion to procure an additional 194 F-22s. The Air Force is continuing to fund programs to modernize the F-22 and make reliability improvements. The Air Force has not.",

DSCA’s waiver review process is based on a number of factors. While there is a decades-old requirement to recover the U.S. government’s investment in the nonrecurring costs of major defense equipment it develops and later sells to foreign governments. In some cases, these offices are reviewing waivers to verify similar information, at times leading to repetitive reviews. The same process is applied despite the amount of nonrecurring costs requested to be waived. Generally, this equipment has gone through operational testing and has entered or is entering full-rate production. Multiple federal entities have a role in the FMS program, which included: the country requesting the waiver, the justification under which the waiver was requested, the requested amount of the waiver, whether or not the waiver was approved, the approved value of the waiver, and the military department responsible for managing the procurement of the major defense equipment associated with the requested waiver. We analyzed the data to determine the number and dollar value of waivers requested for each waiver justification in a manner that maximizes efficiency and effectiveness. In light of the significant growth in the FMS program in recent years, as well as the resulting workload for DSCA and other cognizant DOD components, continuing to streamline the waiver review process would better position DSCA and the military departments to review and decide on the waiver request. However, these systems are not integrated and data limitations precluded certain analysis. The FMS program is a central component of U.S. foreign policy. Our work has shown that only eligible countries received a waiver for equipment standardization. All other countries that did not qualify for equipment standardization submitted waiver requests for loss of sale, except for 2 waiver requests that cited cost savings to the U.S. government. As shown in figure 5, all countries that utilized the waiver review process, the percentage of cases represented by the 813 requested waivers. DSCA officials also stated that they have improved their review times by using digital signatures when concurring on waiver decisions. Our prior work has indicated that concerns have been raised about the timeliness of the FMS program, and a DSCA official stated that these efforts were part of a DSCA initiative to increase efficiencies in the overall FMS process. We interviewed DSCA officials to obtain information on how major defense equipment is recorded in DSAMS and the process they use to determine whether a FMS case includes major defense equipment. DSCA officials stated that the review process for waiver requests requires that multiple offices review all waiver requests, regardless of the amount of nonrecurring costs to be waived or the complexity of the specific circumstances. The FMS program has been criticized for being slow and burdensome. To create efficiencies in the overall FMS program, DSCA could take additional steps to streamline the FMS waivers review process. While DSCA has been delegated authority to waive nonrecurring costs, even though military officials stated an assessment has already been conducted to determine how the proposed sale will advance U.S. national security objectives within the region. In addition, DSCA officials stated that since foreign governments are procuring equipment also used by the U.S. military, by default, purchasing the equipment would result in standardization. After a potential sale, DSCA officials stated that waivers are generally used within 5 years, which coincides with the expiration date of the sales agreement. After a potential sale has received a favorable country team assessment, the only additional requirement is to determine whether the customer is NATO or among the 34 countries eligible for the standardization waiver. Yet while this requirement is easily confirmed, the waiver request may still be reviewed by as many as 11 offices within the military department and DSCA, as well as at the OUSD level. However, we found, for example, DSCA did not adjust its review process based on the value of the nonrecurring costs. DSCA provided a dataset that compares approved waivers to costs waived; however, we could not verify equipment quantities from DSAMS. DSCA officials could not confirm whether the 813 waiver requests that they received during fiscal years 2012 through 2017 represented the universe of all sales eligible for waivers under the FMS program, as DSAMS does not consistently track whether an individual FMS case includes major defense equipment and therefore would be eligible for a waiver or subject to the collection of nonrecurring costs. According to DSCA officials, foreign governments rarely forego submitting waiver requests and, invariably, submission of these requests is considered a standard practice. As a result, with few exceptions, DSC",
  ", age, and work experience, may preclude a return to work. More specifically, the manual instructs disability examiners to classify beneficiaries over age 54½ as “medical improvement not expected” because of the remote likelihood that they will be able to engage in medium or heavy work. If RRB routinely compiled and analyzed these data for its own purposes, it could better monitor CDR program performance. This would be consistent with federal internal control standards, which state that management should use program data for effective program monitoring. Routinely compiling and analyzing CDR program data would also allow RRB to identify potential gaps. In fiscal year 2016, RRB received approximately $12 billion in funding, about half of which came from payroll taxes levied on railroad workers and their employers. Almost all of the funding was used to pay benefits, including unemployment benefits. In addition, RRB’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are responsible for determining the amount of funding for RRB’s programs. RRB’s Office of Management and Budget (OPM) is responsible for determining the amount of funding for RRB’s programs. The Office of Management and Budget is responsible for determining the amount of funding for RRB’s programs. In fiscal year 2016, RRB’s regulations state that it will not routinely review the beneficiary’s continuing eligibility. (See fig. 1.) According to RRB’s guidance, factors such as age and work experience may also affect how and when RRB received a report of medical recovery or identified earnings that could affect entitlement to benefits. In its budget submissions for fiscal years 2017-2019, RRB included a legislative proposal seeking access to these quarterly earnings data, since access is limited by statute. RRB maintains a list of scheduled CDRs in its CDR database. RRB has a list of scheduled CDRs in its CDR database. RRB has a list of scheduled CDRs in its CDR database. RRB has a list of scheduled CDRs in its CDR database. In fiscal years 2007-2016, these taxes averaged $5.2 billion annually. Railroad employers and employees pay Tier I taxes, which are the same as taxes levied on Social Security- covered employers and workers. The taxes fund benefits similar to Social Security retirement and disability. Employers and employees also pay Tier II taxes to finance additional railroad retirement benefits. According to RRB data, a worker must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that (1) has lasted (or is expected to last) at least 1 year or is expected to result in death, and (2) prevents them from engaging in substantial gainful activity, defined as work activity that involves significant physical or mental activities performed for pay or profit. In other words, these workers are essentially deemed unable to engage in any regular employment. In fiscal years 2014-2016, RRB has an earnings reconciliation process to determine which beneficiaries may be excluded from an earnings CDR and which should receive one. In fiscal year 2017, RRB considers whether a beneficiary has any disability-related work expenses, such as the cost of special transportation or medication, which are deducted from any earnings, or if the beneficiary has reached full retirement age. (See fig. 2.) In addition, a beneficiary who returns to work or has earnings from employment is required to report that information to RRB, and the agency may initiate a CDR depending on the circumstances. If a potential overpayment is identified as a result of a CDR, the Disability Benefits Division refers the case to another division within RRB to calculate the overpayment amount. Over the 3 years for which RRB was able to provide information, the agency may identify additional overpayments. RRB’s records show that RRB’s records show that RRB may identify additional overpayments but RRB is slow to calculate overpayments. We determined that the overpayment data RRB provided for CDRs completed during 2014-2016 were incomplete. For example, a case file review of six randomly selected earnings CDRs completed in fiscal year 2016 found that in three of the cases, the office responsible for calculating overpayments, had not calculated the overpayments identified by those 2016 reviews. Our findings and PEMS’s 2016 conclusions indicate that these high-risk medical CDRs have not been effective, the agency expends resources on these reviews that could be used for other purposes that are more effective in identifying ineligible beneficiaries. RRB’s lack of routine data collection and analysis hampers its ability to monitor program performance and determine what changes, if any, should be made to improve the CDR program, including determining the number of beneficiaries in each medical improvement category and the costs and benefits of conducting the various types of reviews. While continuing to conduct high-risk CDRs, RRB may be expending resources that could be used for other purposes that are more effective in identifying ineligible beneficiaries. RRB could be"
