  "U production would be needed. In its October 2015 plan, NNSA identified an option of reprocessing spent U.S. nuclear fuel to obtain unobligated HEU that could be downblended to LEU and used for tritium production. However, this option was not ultimately included in NNSA’s October 2016 mission need statement. This option was not ultimately included in NNSA’s October 2016 mission need statement. According to NNSA and ORNL documents, the small centrifuge experiment will take 3.5 years to achieve a TRL of 3 to 4—successful validation at laboratory scale—and cost approximately $42 million for this validation effort. During our visit to ORNL in December 2016, laboratory representatives told us that prototypes had not yet been constructed and showed us their preliminary design work and initial construction of their facility. However, in February 2016, Centrus had already publicly announced that it would begin decontamination and decommissioning the demonstration plant in spring 2016. An alternate scenario—complete demobilization of the demonstration plant followed by a restart of operations after 10 years—may have more closely reflected conditions at the time. According to a December 2014 estimate provided by Centrus to DOE and N The following is a summary of our assessments. Comprehensive. Best practices state that—to be considered comprehensive—a cost estimate should include both government and contractor costs of the project over its full life cycle, from “cradle to grave.” This includes costs from the inception of the demonstration plant followed by a restart of operations after 10 years—may have more closely reflected conditions at the time. According to a December 2014 estimate provided by Centrus to DOE and N The following is a summary of our assessments. Comprehensive. Best practices state that—to be considered comprehensive—a cost estimate should include both government and contractor costs of the project over its full life cycle, from “cradle to grave.” This includes costs from the inception of the project through design, development, deployment, and operation and maintenance, to retirement of the project. A life cycle cost estimate can support budgetary decisions, key decision points, milestone reviews, and investment decisions. DOE Order 413.3B does not specifically require a life cycle cost estimate at CD-0. Nonetheless, according to best practices, two actions involve nuclear material accounting practices that help preserve supplies of unobligated LEU, and two of the actions involve downblending HEU. NNSA has generally identified the costs and schedules for these actions.",
  "-lowering modification, and, according to FHA officials, some modifications could increase monthly payments for borrowers with a large number of missed payments. As discussed later, our analysis found that outcomes can vary greatly by purchaser, and purchasers may not offer comparable modification options. See appendix IV for information on the types of modifications purchasers have used. Furthermore, FHA may not have the data it needs to evaluate whether payment-lowering modifications offered by purchasers remain sustainable. In the second 2016 sale, FHA began requiring that modified interest rates be fixed for at least 5 years and thereafter that they not increase by more than 1 percent per year. In 2017, FHA also began requiring purchasers to report data related to interest rates for modified loans, including the modified interest rate and the number of years it would remain fixed. In 2017, FHA began requiring borrowers to report data related to interest rates for modified loans. In 2017, FHA began requiring borrowers to report data related to interest rates for modified loans, including the modified interest rate and the number of years it would remain fixed. However, based on our review of reported modification information, none of the purchasers from this sale reported these rates. Additionally, about 22 percent of the modifications offered to borrowers whose loans were sold in the 2015 sale and later included a deferment. These rates generally exceeded the foreclosure and short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure estimates for similar, unsold loans (34 and about 9 percent, respectively). Further, the share of loans sold through NSO pools relative to national pools has increased, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales. As noted previously, NSO and nonprofit pools have additional regulatory requirements, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales. FHA has additional regulatory requirements, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales.

To determine the status of the 2017 CDBG-DR grants, we reviewed relevant laws and the Federal Register notices allocating the CDBG-DR funds and interviewed HUD officials to determine the steps grantees were required to take before signing a grant agreement and expending their 2017 CDBG-DR funds. We reviewed key documents—such as documentation on financial processes and procedures, implementation plans, and action plans—to determine when they were submitted and approved. To determine how much CDBG-DR funding the 2017 grantees had drawn down, we examined data from the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting system as of January 2019 (the most recent month available during our review). To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed relevant documentation on the system and interviewed officials knowledgeable about the data.

  " policy statement for CSPF to eliminate asset allocation targets for each asset class and instead specified that the plan invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 25 percent in nonpublicly traded assets. After 1999, CSPF’s investment policy under other, successive named fiduciaries continued to be broad and generally specified that the plan should invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities. Specifically J.P. Morgan’s and Northern Trust’s consecutive investment policies for part of the plan’s assets continued to specify that a majority of the plan’s assets be invested in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 25 percent in nonpublicly traded assets. Goldman Sachs’ investment policy for another part of the plan’s assets did not specify asset allocation details but indicated slightly higher tolerance for risk in conjunction with its equity portfolio. CSPF trustees said that named fiduciaries considered investing in alternative assets, but instead chose to increase the plan’s allocation to equity assets. The named fiduciaries’ investment policies did not vary significantly over this period because CSPF trustees said that the plan’s investment return was the same as the investment return calculation. The plan’s investment return was the same as the investment return calculation. The plan’s investment return was the same as the investment return calculation.

Table 2 compares CSPF’s asset allocations for selected asset categories to the median allocations of its TUCS comparator group. In 1996, compared to the TUCS medians, CSPF had relatively lower proportions of its assets in both equities and fixed income and a relatively higher proportion in real estate. Twenty years later (2016), CSPF had relatively higher proportions of its assets in both equities, fixed income, retirement ages, and other economic and demographic assumptions.

  " level for the LCR. EPA has efforts underway to reconsider the action level for the LCR, which may include a change in the action level from one that is based on technical feasibility, to one that also considers lead exposure in vulnerable populations such as infants and young children, which EPA refers to as a health-based benchmark. EPA anticipates issuing comprehensive revisions to the LCR by February 2020. While the 3Ts guidance is not contingent on the LCR, EPA officials told us they would consider updates to the 3Ts guidance, including the 20 ppb action level, as they consider revisions to the LCR. By updating the 3Ts guidance to include an action level for school districts that incorporates available scientific modeling regarding vulnerable population exposures, EPA could have greater assurance that school districts are able to limit children’s exposure to lead in school drinking water. EPA has emphasized the importance of addressing elevated lead levels in school drinking water. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead in drinking water. EPA could have greater assurance that school districts are able to limit children’s exposure to lead in school drinking water. EPA has emphasized the importance of addressing elevated lead levels in school drinking water through its 3Ts guidance, but has not communicated necessary information about action levels and other key topics consistent with the external communication standard under federal standards for internal control. According to EPA, CDC, and others, eliminating sources of lead before exposure can occur is considered the best strategy to protect children from potential adverse. In response to our recommendation to improve Education’s websites, Education said it would identify and include an information portal dedicated to enhancing the usability of federal resources related to testing for and addressing lead in school drinking water. Also, Education said it is interested in increasing coordination across all levels of government and it shares the view expressed in our report that improved federal coordination, including with EPA, will better enhance collaboration to encourage testing for lead in school drinking water. Education said it would develop a plan for disseminating relevant resources to its key stakeholder groups and 59 percent informed parents about their plans to test; similar percentages provided information about the testing results. We identified a range of approaches to communicating testing efforts in the 17 school districts we interviewed. Some school districts reported issuing press releases, putting letters in multiple languages in students’ backpacks, sending emails to parents",
  " that the Select Agent Program did not consistently refer laboratories to investigative entities for violations of the select agent regulations or enforce regulations related to incidents involving incomplete inactivation, and we found that this appears to be true beyond incidents involving incomplete inactivation as well. Senior program officials told us that, even without joint strategic planning documents, the CDC and APHIS components of the Select Agent Program manage fragmentation by collaborating on many aspects of the program, such as through maintaining frequent communication at the director level. They also said that the program had not developed a joint mission statement or strategic planning tools in the past because they prioritized other efforts in recent years, including responding to incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2015, addressing recommendations from recent reports, and developing a new database for the Select Agent Program. In addition, each component of the program has generally focused on its own agency’s needs when conducting workforce planning.

In addition, each component of the program has generally focused on its own agency’s needs when determining the focus of their inspections. For example, according to agency officials in Great Britain and Canada, because they have not found stringent inventory requirements to be effective in reducing biological safety risks in the laboratory, neither country places as much focus, time, or resources on inventory management as the Select Agent Program does. Some other regulatory sectors in the United States are also structurally independent from regulated facilities as a mechanism to ensure independence. For example, we and other audit organizations are subject to an external peer review at least once every 3 years that includes a review of documentation related to independence, among other issues. According to senior program officials we interviewed, the program as a whole has not engaged in comprehensive risk management activities but they would be willing to do so in the future.

For example, the Defense investment in our sample was the seventh increment of an ongoing investment; Energy’s system was the first of two phases; the DHS investment was rolled out to two locations prior to deployment to 37 additional locations; and Transportation’s investment had been part of a prototype deployed to four airports. Common factors critical to the success of three or more of the seven investments were: 1. Program officials were actively engaged with stakeholders. 2. Program staff had the necessary knowledge and skills. 3. Senior department and agency executives supported the programs. 4. End users and stakeholders were involved in the development of requirements. 5. End users participated in testing system functionality prior to formal end-user acceptance testing. 6. Government and contractor staff were stable and consistent. 7. Program officials maintained regular communication with the prime contractor. 8. Programs received sufficient funding. These critical factors help support OMB’s objective of improving the management of large-scale IT acquisitions across the federal government.

The officials stated that they did not see a reason to create a separate policy for CIO certification, since the agency always looks at using incremental development for new projects and the agency certifies the investment in the major IT business case. Further, OPM officials stated that their agency had been on a path to address the FITARA requirements, but progress was slowed due to the lack of a budget for fiscal year 2017.

  ". We compared the agencies’ actions to the key features of interagency collaboration that we have previously identified. We reviewed agencies’ collaboration at the regional level by surveying the seven agencies about their joint actions on activities related to tribal drinking water and wastewater in six states— Alaska, Arizona, California, New York, Oklahoma, and South Dakota— and by conducting a network analysis using the survey responses. We selected agency regional offices within these six states as the unit of analysis because the federal agencies organize their field structures differently, with some using region, district, area, or state offices to work with tribes—we refer to all of these office types as regional offices. According to EPA databases, tribes operate about 950 public drinking water systems and about 340 public wastewater systems. Drinking water systems often include groundwater wells, water treatment plants, and pipelines to deliver water to homes. However, according to agency officials involved with the task force, there may be additional opportunities to improve the efficiency of their collaboration at the national level. For example, the report template has been helpful for tribes since they no longer have to produce different versions of the same document when submitting multiple applications to different agencies. We selected the nonprobability sample of six states to include a large percentage of the number of federally recognized tribes, to obtain a range in the total federal obligations to tribes from non-tribal specific programs such as from its Water and Waste Disposal program as well as the Section 306C Colonias, Emergency Community Water Assistance Grant, Predevelopment Planning Grants, Special Evaluation Assistance for Rural Communities and Households, and Technical Assistance and Training programs. We selected the nonprobability sample of six states to include a large percentage of the number of tribes in the state. We also asked the agency regional office to describe the factors, if any, that hindered its collaboration with the other agency. To quantify the extent of interagency collaboration during the past 3 years and the potential for future collaboration among the federal agencies we surveyed, we conducted a Network Analysis—a method of analyzing the patterns of interaction among multiple entities. Specifically, we aggregated the survey responses to our questions about drinking water and wastewater activities and collaborative mechanisms for each pair of agencies in all six states. We configured these aggregated data into networks representing the estimated costs of capital improvement projects needed to repair, replace, and upgrade existing tribal and other public drinking water systems over the following 20 years. In its 2013 report, EPA estimated the costs of future tribal drinking water needs of public systems at approximately $",

U.S. and Colombian officials stated that the U.S. and Colombian government’s counternarcotics strategy under the peace accord is to implement a voluntary eradication and crop substitution program. In August 2016, the Colombian government and the FARC reached a peace agreement ending more than five decades of conflict. The peace agreement was the culmination of four years of formal negotiations. In October 2016, however, Colombian voters narrowly defeated a referendum on whether to accept the peace agreement. After the voters rejected the agreement, the Colombian government and the FARC worked to make certain revisions and signed a second accord. The Colombian Congress then approved the revised agreement in November 2016. The Colombian government has estimated that it will cost $43 billion to implement the peace agreement over 15 years but State has estimated that the cost will be between $80 billion and $100 billion. The peace agreement included agreements on six major topics: land and rural development, the FARC’s political participation after disarmament, illicit crops and Eradication. Following the conclusion of the U.S.-Colombia High Level Dialogue in March 2018, the U.S. and Colombian governments pledged to expand counternarcotics cooperation over the next 5 years with the goal of reducing Colombia’s estimated coca cultivation by 1 hectare. Three other studies concluded eradication efforts had no net effect on reducing the coca or cocaine supplies, or have led to increased coca cultivation.

  " guidance states that contracting officers need to evaluate the estimated amount of reverse auction fees that will be paid when assessing whether prices are fair or reasonable. DHS’s May 2017 guidance states that contracting officers need to understand the fees charged by a provider, and determine and document that the fee structure represents a fair and reasonable cost and offers the best value to the government. None of the agency-wide guidance we reviewed at the five agencies detailed the fee structure of each reverse auction platform used by the respective agency. As a result, contracting officials’ ability to understand and assess the fees—an existing requirement in OFPP guidance and at the Army, Interior, and DHS—is hindered. Neither State nor Interior had guidance that detailed the specific fee structures of reverse auctions. Reverse auctions can be opened to any vendor on the open market or can be opened to any vendor on the open market.

Cost-reimbursement type contracts allow the agency to contract for work when circumstances do not allow the agency to sufficiently define its requirements or estimate its costs to allow for a fixed-price contract. As we describe in our report, EM follows a Site Specific approach to evaluate its M&O contractors that uses detailed performance criteria specific to each contract. Under this approach, most performance criteria we reviewed are objective criteria, and a few are broader, subjective criteria. Tables 13 through 16 provide examples of some of the specific criteria EM used at each site. We provide examples rather than a full list because each site has numerous individual metrics, which are often quite technical. Table 13 and 14 provide examples of EM’s objective performance criteria, which are defined based on quantifiable metrics (e.g., whether a contractor completed a task on or before a scheduled date).

In March 2017, we reported that DOE needed quality data to manage its risk of fraud and recommended that DOE require contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with amounts charged to the government. DOE did not concur with the recommendation and has not taken steps to implement it. Because DOE does not require its contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with amounts charged to DOE, it is not well positioned to employ data analytics as a fraud detection tool.

The Standards for Internal Control state that management should implement control activities through policies and documentation and externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity’s objective. Until OMB provides additional guidelines directing agencies to report more-complete and more-detailed information related to their progress on both financial and nonfinancial risks, some agencies may continue to report incomplete information on their full range of fraud risks and activities they are performing to manage these risks. On the basis of the limitations we identified in agencies’ annual financial reports, Congress and OMB do not have complete and detailed information about agencies’ progress implementing FRDAA, according to agencies we surveyed and our assessment of OMB documents. For example, as previously mentioned, agencies did not report on their full range of fraud risks and activities they are performing to manage these risks.

  " has increasingly shifted attention to preparing students for careers in STEM fields. The federal role also changes in response to differing policy views. One policy perspective maintains that the federal role should be to support innovation across the economy. This policy approach has underpinned innovation and economic growth since at least the end of World War II. As we reported previously, another perspective is that the federal role should be to support individual sectors. Critics of the latter perspective argue that the government should not “pick winners and losers” in commercial contexts because it is unlikely that the government will have sufficient information or foresight about an individual firm’s or a particular technology’s growth potential to select it for special subsidy. This view advocates allocating resources through market mechanisms because such mechanisms are anticipated to result in U.S. investments that are most efficient and best suited to the comparative advantages of the United States. However, the federal government has supported individual sectors from research and development through implementation, most often because of the government’s own needs in areas deemed important for national security (e.g., aerospace and defense). This expert further stated that as a result, graduate students are not taught later stage applied work relevant to industry because that has not been the case. Similarly, in a 2012 report, the National Research Council stated that manufacturing is a partnership among the University of California, DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and the University of Illinois. However, the federal government has supported individual sectors from research and development through implementation, most often because of the government’s own needs in areas deemed important for national security (e.g., aerospace and defense). The linear, or pipeline, model of innovation presents innovation as a succession of outputs that transfer to the next level as inputs. The three senior officials who served as co-chairs of the QIS working group said they were not aware of any federal goals or outcomes for quantum computing research, and DOE officials said that clarifying common goals could help interagency collaboration on quantum computing research.

  " of the electricity system is managed by entities such as a local utility, which this report collectively refers to as system operators. Because electric energy is not typically stored in large quantities, system operators must constantly balance the generation and consumption of electricity to maintain reliability. To do this, system operators utilize a system of sensors and controls to monitor power consumption and generation from a centralized location. Operators use computerized systems to send signals to power plants and other grid components to adjust their output to match changes in consumption. Electromagnetic events can interrupt or damage some of the equipment system operators use, which can cause a disturbance in control systems (for example, such events can cause relays to unintentionally operate, which can disable system protection equipment). Because the electric power system increasingly operates at or near reliability limits during peak demand periods, a relatively modest disturbance to the system can potentially pose a risk to system reliability. In the United States, the electrical infrastructure is primarily operated by private industry.

The latter result is consistent with the idea that soft costs scale with the number of units, but not with the size or a portion of a funding gap. Projects with Rural Development loans were associated with lower construction and soft costs. For construction costs, the result is consistent with the loans being able to be used for projects characterized by lower- than-average costs of construction. Soft costs may be affected more directly to the extent that Rural Development loans provide a key source of funding that may reduce the difficulty of other project financing efforts. The HOME indicator was associated with modestly significant higher construction and soft costs. Slightly more than one-third of projects across all allocating agencies received HOME funds.

In particular, we reviewed FOIA requests received by these four agencies during the period in which Treasury owned at least 50 percent or more common shares in the corporations. We reviewed the FOIA requests to determine the resolution of the request and the length of time it took the agency to respond. Lastly, we interviewed agency officials to better understand if and how FOIA requests were received and processed. We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 through June 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) prescribes nine specific categories of information that are exempt from disclosure. These exemptions are described in the table below.

For example, the office offers an annual training class that provides a basic overview of the act, as well as hands-on courses about the procedural requirements involved in processing a request from start to finish. In addition, it offers a seminar outlining successful litigation strategies for attorneys who handle FOIA cases. OIP also provides agencies customized training upon request. Figure 3 summarizes the extent to which the 18 agencies implemented the selected FOIA requirements.

  "GC trustees the plan and pays benefits up to statutory limits. The low prevalence of unclaimed retirement accounts that we found in these locations is likely due, in part, to participants using these mechanisms to stay connected to their retirement savings. In two of the five locations we reviewed, Australia and Switzerland, plans transfer dormant accounts belonging to separated employees to a centralized institution that is actively monitored by regulators. These accounts generally remain within these institutions until claims for benefits are made by the participant. As part of the standard termination process, PBGC’s Missing Participants Program connects participants—missing when the plan closes out—to their retirement benefits, in part by maintaining a centralized, online database the public can use to find lost retirement benefits. SSA provides retirement benefits to eligible individuals under the federal Social Security Old Age and Survivors’ Insurance program (Social Security). Although SSA does not oversee workplace retirement plans, SSA maintains data that are reported to IRS by plans using Form 8955- SSA on separated participants with vested but undistributed benefits. When individuals claim Social Security benefits, SSA may provide them with a “Potential Private Pension Benefit Information” notice that indicates they may be entitled to a retirement benefit through a past employer.

(Recommendation 2) In commenting on a draft of this report, SSA agreed with our two recommendations to (1) establish public performance measures for the accuracy and consistency of administrative law judges’ decisions, and (2) systematically evaluate its various quality assurance reviews and take steps to reduce or better manage any unnecessary overlap among them. SSA stated that it would address both recommendations as part of a comprehensive assessment and refinement of its oversight roles and processes. SSA made several other comments about one of our conclusions and our analysis of variation in administrative law judge allowance rates, which we discuss below. SSA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. In its comments, SSA described its evolving oversight activities at the hearings level, including providing policy guidance and training for judges, capturing and utilizing data to gain a better understanding of trends and challenges, and implementing additional oversight review processes, all of which we discussed in our report. SSA continues to develop and implement initiatives aimed at improving hearing decisions, without evaluating the potential for overlap with existing quality assurance reviews.

SSA continues to develop and implement initiatives aimed at improving hearing decisions, without evaluating the potential for overlap with existing quality assurance reviews. For example, as part of its backlog reduction plan known as the Compassionate And As we show in Appendix I, Table 7, only 2.3 percent of the judges in our study population heard fewer than 250 claims per year. This group of judges had an unadjusted allowance rate of 61.9 percent, very similar to the allowance rate among judges who heard 500-699 claims per year (61.6 percent). Furthermore, the statistical methods we used to estimate the distributions of allowance rates (multilevel models) adjust the estimates for judges with fewer claims by weighting them more heavily toward the overall approval rate. This mitigates against judges with smaller caseloads, and therefore higher sampling variation, from contributing overestimated allowance rates that might have inflated our estimated variation across judges.

HUD disagreed with the fifth recommendation to develop and implement a process to monitor MTW agencies' reserves. HUD stated that there is no language in the 1996 Act that limits the reserves of MTW agencies to a certain level. Although one of the requirements of the MTW demonstration is to establish a reasonable rent policy to encourage employment and self- sufficiency, HUD has not defined self-sufficiency, but rather allowed each agency to develop its own definition. To measure the extent to which certain MTW agencies, including rent-reform activities, encourage households to achieve self-sufficiency. To measure the extent to which certain MTW agencies, including rent-reform activities, encourage households to achieve self-sufficiency, HUD requires MTW agencies to report on the number of households that transitioned to self-sufficiency, among other things.

In addition, some agencies provided analyses that went beyond those required for annual reports, including evaluations from third-party researchers. For example, one agency partners with a local university to conduct an annual survey that allows the agency to assess the effect of its rent-reform activities on households. During the course of our work, a HUD official said the agency had not required MTW agencies to report annual reevaluations.

In its October 2017 implementation plan, ONHIR suggested BIA provide post-move counseling to the 52 clients who will remain under warranty after ONHIR’s proposed closure date of September 2018, according to ONHIR’s comments on a draft transition plan. The Settlement Act as amended also does not specify whether ONHIR, the Navajo Nation, or the relocatees should receive lease revenues. However, as we reported, under BIA’s regulations for trust land it administers, revenue from leases is to be either paid directly to the tribe whose trust land is being leased or to BIA, which deposits the revenue in the tribe’s trust account that generally earns interest. BIA officials told us leases of trust land that provide for BIA to retain lease revenue would not be consistent with the agency’s trust responsibility. Half of the 22 leases we reviewed required the lessee to pay a non- nominal amount (i.e., more than $1 a year) of annual rent to ONHIR.

For example, the regulatory flexibility analyses for a joint OCC and Federal Reserve rule discussed how the agencies estimated costs of implementing new capital requirements but did not disclose the data sources or methodology used to calculate the costs of creditworthiness measurement activities. A lack of information necessary to understand how an agency evaluated a rule’s economic impact on small entities may limit the extent to which the public and other interested parties can meaningfully comment on the analyses. Although a regulatory flexibility analysis is required only for rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, few final analyses concluded that the rules would have such an impact. Figure 1 illustrates the decision process that agencies must follow to comply with RFA. Section 610 of RFA requires agencies to review, within 10 years of a final rule’s publication, those rules assessed as having a significant economic impact and the remainder did not have a clear conclusion. Many of the SEC rules we reviewed focused on reasons why alternatives were not appropriate and did not discuss specific options for minimizing economic impact on small entities. As discussed previously, nearly all of the Federal Reserve’s regulatory flexibility analyses have a significant economic impact on small entities. For example, in December 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) concluded there would be no significant impact and the remainder did not have a clear conclusion.

Examples of implemented recommendations include DOD’s issuance of adjudication guidance related to incomplete investigative reports, ODNI and OPM’s jointly proposed chapter and part to the Code of Federal Regulations clarifying, among other things, the position sensitivity designation of national security positions, and DHS’s issuance of new standards for tracking information on security clearance revocations and appeals. The 21 recommendations that remain open as of November 2017 focused on different aspects of the personnel security clearance process. First, in February 2012, we reported on background investigation pricing and costs, and we found, among other things, that the Performance Accountability Council had not provided the executive branch with guidance on cost savings. As a result, we have added language to the report to include DOD responsibility for designing, developing, operating, defending, and continuously updating and modernizing, as necessary, IT systems that support all background investigation processes conducted by NBIB.

They said that CFPB intends to review the effectiveness of its guidance, but did not indicate when this review would be completed. Until the agency assesses how well community banks and credit unions understand TRID requirements, CFPB may not be able to effectively respond to the risk that some smaller institutions have implemented TRID incorrectly, unnecessarily burdening their staff and delaying consumers’ home purchases. CFPB staff said that preliminary results from the National Survey of Mortgage Originations conducted in 2017 found that consumer confidence in mortgage lending increased. While CFPB staff said that this may indicate that TRID, which became effective in October 2015, has helped consumers better understand mortgage terms, they noted that the complete survey results are not expected to be released until 2018. CFPB staff said that these results should provide valuable information on the extent to which community banks and credit unions are required to comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974; and ensure that property appraisers are sufficiently independent.

  " of the overall human capital strategy to ensure effective workforce planning. According to Marine Corps officials, they have not taken additional steps to address workforce challenges in part because inventories of UAS operators and officers have grown and squadrons have generally attained readiness goals and accomplished their deployment missions despite personnel shortages. Further, these officials stated that low morale and career satisfaction could be partially caused by the current transition from the RQ-7 Shadow UAS to the RQ-21 Blackjack, and to the relative newness of the officer career field. Without exploring these or other human capital flexibilities to improve morale and career satisfaction and maximize operators’ availability to squadrons, the Marine Corps may face continued challenges in meeting personnel requirements and the growing demands of expanding operations and increasing UAS inventories. Moreover, as the Marine Corps budgets for additional resources to establish its own school for UAS operator training, flexibilities that could improve retention and maximize operator availability could also help ensure the greatest return on its investment in the UAS operator workforce. For almost 20 years we have identified strategic management of human capital as a high-risk area across government in part because of persistent gaps in mission critical skills.

  "IG initiated a more comprehensive audit of the agency’s IT management that is ongoing. FEMA has identified 10 primary legacy IT systems that support its grants management activities. According to the agency, most of these systems were developed to support specific grant programs or grant categories. Table 2 summarizes the 10 primary legacy systems. Table 2 summarizes the 10 primary legacy systems. According to FEMA officials, the 10 primary grant systems are all in operation (several have been for decades) and are not interoperable. Additionally, the four selected grant program offices are responsible for 16 of the total 45 grant programs and are users of five of the nine primary legacy IT systems. In addition, FEMA officials stated that while these work arounds have helped the agency partially address capability gaps with its primary systems, they are often nonstandardized processes, and introduce the potential for information security risks and errors. This environment has contributed to labor-intensive manual processes and an increased burden for grant recipients. As of April 2018, the four selected grant program offices are responsible for the following: The initial cost estimate assumed that GMM would implement a software-as-a-service model, meaning that FEMA would rely on a service provider to deliver software applications and the underlying infrastructure to run them.

State databases searched as part of the check includes but are not limited to: Pennsylvania criminal history records; Juvenile records, contained within the criminal history record file; Mental Health File, containing involuntary commitment information and adjudication of mental health commitment, active warrants, and straw purchases, among others. After PSP began investigating all firearms denials in 2014, according to PSP officials, the number of denials remained largely the same, but the number of investigations increased by 30 percent (from 6,715 to 8,717). This increase was driven by cases in which the prohibiting category was drug-related, which increased by about 300 referrals (62 percent increase), and involved misdemeanor convictions, which increased by about 250 referrals (34 percent increase). Cases in which the prohibiting category was related to mental health or protection orders also increased by 42 percent (about 200 referrals) and 21 percent (about 300 referrals), respectively. Figure 6 shows the breakdown of investigation referrals by prohibiting category from fiscal years 2011 through 2017. According to officials from our six selected ATF field divisions, standard denial referrals may meet USAOs criteria and be referred to ATF’s DENI Branch. According to Oregon troopers, denial investigations that are recommended for prosecution often involve convictions for felonies, misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, and restraining orders. The troopers said that the number of firearms denials should be referred for investigation, or which denials are more likely to be accepted for prosecution.

  " and transcripts related to ticketing issues. We examined summary-level information about each piece of literature, and from this review, identified articles that were germane to our report. We generally focused on articles from 2009 and later. We identified additional articles and reports through citations in literature we reviewed and from expert recommendations. For the articles we used to cite empirical findings or to support arguments on advantages and disadvantages of selected resale restrictions or disclosure requirements, we conducted a methodology and soundness review. We eliminated one study on pricing and one study on price caps because we believed the methods were not sufficiently rigorous. Analysts followed a protocol to help ensure consistency of observations and completed a data collection instrument for each website. A second analyst independently reviewed each website to verify the accuracy of information collected by the first analyst. Any discrepancies between the two analysts were identified, discussed, and resolved by referring to the source websites. A GAO investigator acting in an undercover capacity contacted the customer service departments of three large secondary ticket exchanges to inquire about the validity of the information collected by the second analyst.

Similar legislation has been introduced in several other states in recent years. The use of nontransferable tickets, even in states where they are legal, is relatively uncommon. For example, an artist advocacy group told us that some events that use nontransferable tickets are most common for the most popular events and were often purchased on the street outside the venue or through an online classified advertisement. According to industry representatives, fraudulent ticketing is rare on secondary market exchanges, in part because the exchanges can take action against sellers of fraudulent tickets, such as fining them or banning them from future sales. The National Association of Ticket Brokers told us the most common fraudulent activity they must address is credit card fraud by buyers rather than invalid tickets posted by sellers. Ticket resale prices can be significantly higher than primary market prices. The New York State Attorney General’s Office of the Attorney General’s",
  " agencies’ roles and responsibilities have been fully clarified, NIST carries out its measurement services and documentary-standards development activities across several agency laboratories. NIST’s standards activities support the development and use of standards to enhance the economic and technological competitiveness of the United States. NIST takes a variety of steps to identify agency stakeholders’ measurement-service and documentary-standards needs, has procedures to support the prioritization of measurement services and standards activities in the agency, and has developed mechanisms for communicating with stakeholders. While these steps help NIST address challenges to identifying and prioritizing needs and communicating with stakeholders, some aspects of these efforts do not fully align with federal guidance or NIST policy. Identifying measurement-service and documentary-standards needs: NIST identifies stakeholders’ measurement-service or documentary-standards needs in various ways, including discussions with industry by NIST technical staff, attendance at trade shows and scientific professional society meetings, workshops hosted by NIST on technology areas of interest, and participation in planning activities of SDOs, among other ways. OMB Circular A-119 provides that agencies should be broadly engaged in the agency’s standards-related activities so as to ensure intra-agency coordination and have sufficient authority to ensure compliance with Circular A-119. In addition, the ICSP charter allows the Secretary of Commerce to invite additional agencies as members or invited observers. However, NIST does not regularly perform a comprehensive assessment of its measurement services and standards activities. NIST also participates in SDO administrative groups, such as the ANSI Government Members Forum, that can alert NIST to important international and domestic standards activities. Through participation ’s ongoing efforts to assess how well its services align with stakeholder needs. Through participation ’s ongoing efforts to assess how well its services align with stakeholder needs and identify any gaps. Conducting comprehensive reviews of NIST’s measurement services and documentary standards activities would provide NIST with greater confidence that its activities align with stakeholders’ needs, consistent with internal control standards. Conducting such reviews would also help NIST address the recommendations made by its recent external reviews and could be used to support NIST’s efforts to support NIST’s efforts to develop the strategic plan called for by the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act. Prioritizing among needs: NIST has a process for deciding when new standards activities are warranted; however, decision-making about documentary-standards development activities is decentralized, and NIST management and",

The largest of the administrations, in terms of workforce, is VHA and its associated Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN). VHA is estimated to employ about 316,800 employees in 2017, followed by the VBA and NCA with about 22,700 and 1,850 employees, respectively. The remaining 15,000 employees are in various staff offices. VA concurred with our 15th recommendation, that the Assistant Secretary of OAWP develop a time frame for the completion of published guidance for the development of an internal process to monitor cases referred to facility and program offices. As of March 2018, two of these senior officials received performance pay, and appear to still be employed at VA. Through our analysis of this spreadsheet, we identified 5 fields out of 12 that did not have standardization that could be useful to analyze misconduct. Alleged Offense 2 and Final Disposition—We found this field contained at least two different variations of charge type (i.e., charged, charged – Issued Ticket), six different variations of open type (for example, open/referred to Court, open/cvb), and two different variations of closed type (i.e., closed, case closed). VAPS officials stated that this field is a comprehensive analysis of misconduct to identify and address trends. See appendix II for a further listing of the five data files and the corresponding fields that were missing data. In addition, we found that several data files had options such as “not applicable” or “no” for certain fields so that the field would not be left blank, but these options were not consistently used. In addition, the Complainant Name field within the Legacy Referral Tracking List was blank for some entries and not applicable (N/A) for others. Accordingly, we did not know whether",

Evaluating the implementation of the MOU and making any needed changes, including setting specific timeframes for periodic evaluations of actions taken under the MOU, would help ensure the goals of collaboration are fully met. Federal reviews of certain antimicrobial chemicals before they are used in meat and poultry plants leave gaps with respect to worker safety and health. FSIS inspectors and workers in meat and poultry plants are exposed to antimicrobial chemicals every day, as they are commonly used during all work shifts, both on animal and bird carcasses and on work surfaces and machinery. In general, the potential for chemical exposure is greater for plant workers than for FSIS inspectors. According to officials we spoke with at various plants, plant workers handle these chemicals by receiving shipments, opening containers, and filling machines with the chemical, among other ways, while FSIS inspectors are generally not present at various times that workers are using the chemical, most notably, when the plant is being cleaned between shifts. OSHA officials told us they developed such training for FSIS in the mid to late 1990s, but according to FSIS officials the course was too excessive and burdensome for FSIS inspectors.

By FSIS establishing a process to regularly share the worker safety information it collects during reviews of new chemicals—internally with FSIS inspectors and externally with plant management, OSHA, and NIOSH—the federal government will be better positioned to use existing resources to support the safety and health of plant workers and FSIS inspectors. As discussed above, FSIS conducts reviews of new ingredients and technologies, including antimicrobial chemicals, proposed for use on meat and poultry products8. OSHA has not comprehensively tracked its compliance assistance activities in the past, but officials told us the agency launched a database module that started tracking these activities in fiscal year 2017.

  "The Trump Administration's Nuclear Posture Review, released on February 2, 2018, includes plans for the deployment of new U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The document noted that the allies are \"resolved to seek a safer world for all and to create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons in accordance with the goals of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, in a way that promotes international stability, and is based on the principle of undiminished security for all.\" It also noted that a debate about nonstrategic nuclear weapons can no longer focus exclusively on the U.S. and Russian arsenals. For example, India and Pakistan have joined the list of nations that may potentially resort to nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict. Toward this end, the allies pledged to \"seek to create the conditions for further reductions in the future.\" The Strategic Concept indicated that the goal in these reductions should be to \"seek Russian agreement to increase transparency on its nuclear weapons in Europe and relocate these weapons away from the territory of NATO members.\" Moreover, the document noted that this arms control process \"must take into account the disparity with the greater Russian stockpiles of short-range nuclear weapons.\" Hence, even though NATO no longer viewed Russia as an adversary, the allies apparently agreed that the disparity in nonstrategic nuclear weapons could create security concerns for some members of the alliance. In recognition of different views about the role or nuclear weapons in In addition, in response to concerns about Russian nuclear doctrine, the statement emphasized that \"any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict\" and, \"if the United States were to be threatened however, NATO has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that an adversary could hope to achieve.\" On the other hand, the Warsaw Summit Communique, which was released after the Warsaw Summit in July 2018, stated that the United States would \"retain the capability to forward-deploy U.S. nuclear weapons on tactical fighter-bombers\" and that the United States would seek to \"expand consultations with allies and partners to address how to ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the U.S. extended deterrent. No changes in U.S. extended deterrence capabilities will be made without close consultations with our allies and partners.\" Discussions about the presence of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons at bases in Europe and their role in NATO's strategy also increased in 2009 and 2010 during the drafting of",

The SBA also announced that eliminating guaranty fees for 7(a) loans was part of its broader effort to \"reduce barriers to small business success.\" The SBA waived the up-front, one-time loan guaranty fee and ongoing servicing fee for 7(a) loans of $150,000 or less approved in FY2014 and FY2015 as a means to encourage the demand for smaller 7(a) loans. Borrowers may use 7(a) loans not more than once during any fiscal year to reduce barriers to small business success. The SBA waived the up-front, one-time loan guaranty fee for 7(a) loans of $250,000 or less approved in FY2018. The SBA also waived 50% of the up-front, one-time loan guaranty fee on all non-SBAExpress 7(a) loans to veterans of $125,001 to $350,000 in FY2018. In addition, P.L. 114-38, the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, provided statutory authorization and made permanent the veteran's fee waiver in the SBAExpress program, except during any upcoming fiscal year for which the President's budget, submitted to Congress, includes a cost for the 7(a) loans of $125,000 or less approved in FY2018.",

In January 2018, the Federal Communications Commission adopted rules requiring carriers to improve geo-targeting of wireless emergency alerts (WEA)—alerts to cell phones issued through IPAWS. Carriers must comply with these rules by November 30, 2019. The 116 th Congress may examine roles and responsibilities for issuing different alerts, and consider policies that clarify alerting procedures. Congress may also consider investments in activities (e.g., best practices) to improve local alerting capabilities, and programs that educate individuals on the appropriate response to alerts. Lastly, Congress may examine state and local back-up alerting capabilities in the event communication systems fail, and wireless alerts cannot be delivered.

In addition, as part of the GCC, the UAE negotiated with the United States a September 2012 \"GCC-U.S. Framework Agreement on Trade, Economic, Investment, and Technical Cooperation\"—a GCC-wide trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA). The agreement was negotiated by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). As noted, because of the UAE's relative wealth, it receives only very small amounts of U.S. foreign assistance. In 1994, the UAE joined with the other Gulf monarchies in ending enforcement of the Arab League's secondary and tertiary boycotts (boycotts of companies doing business with Israel and on companies that deal with companies that do business with Israel). In August 2018, the head of state-owned Dubai Ports World, which has ties with Israeli shipping company Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. and other Israeli firms, visited Israel. In 2015, several U.S. airlines asserted that two UAE airlines, Emirates Air (Dubai-based) and Etihad Air (Abu Dhabi-based), as well as Qatar Airways, had an unfair competitive advantage because of their proximity to the United States. In 2016, the UAE announced that it would no longer be a member of the Arab League. In 2017, the UAE announced that it would no longer be a member of the Arab League.

Regardless of the merits of these positions, the GDPR may remain a focal point of discussion in the debate over whether the United States should develop a more comprehensive data protection policy. Although some commentators argue that the federal government should supplement the current patchwork of federal data protection laws with more comprehensive legislation modeled on the CCPA or GDPR, some Trump Administration officials have criticized these legislative approaches and questioned whether they will improve data privacy outcomes. The Administration has argued that many comprehensive data privacy models have resulted in \"long, legal, regulator-focused privacy policies and check boxes, which only help a very small number of users[.]\" Rather than pursuing a prescriptive model in which the government defines (or prescribes) data protection rules, the Trump Administration advocates for what it describes as an outcome-based approach whereby the government focuses on the \"outcomes of organizational practices, rather than on dictating what those practices should be.\" The Administration has argued that many comprehensive data privacy models have resulted in \"long, legal, regulator-focused privacy policies and check boxes, which only help a very small number of users[.]\" Rather than pursuing a prescriptive model in which the government defines (or prescribes) data protection rules, the Trump Administration advocates for what it describes as an outcome-based approach whereby the government focuses on the \"outcomes of organizational practices, rather than on dictating what those practices should be.\" The Administration has argued that many comprehensive data privacy models have resulted in \"long, legal, regulator-focused privacy policies and check boxes, which only help a very small number of users[.]\" Second, the plain text of the FTC Act deprives the FTC of jurisdiction over several categories of entities, including banks, common carriers, and nonprofits. Third, the FTC generally lacks authority to issue rules under the APA's notice-and-comment process that is typically used by agencies to issue regulations. Rather, the FTC must use a more burdensome—and, consequently, rarely used—process under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. As some FTC Commissioners and commentators have noted, these legal limitations may be significant in determining the appropriate federal enforcement provisions in any national data security legislation.

The Greek Cypriots long have argued that all Turkish military forces would have to leave the island, beginning immediately after an agreement was adopted. They argue that the U.N. or the EU can offer security guarantees to all citizens in the two member states. Therefore, once the entire island became part of the EU, the Greek Cypriots could again come under a good deal of pressure from his presidential opponents for his failure to gain an acceptable outcome at Crans Montana and his role in squelching the enosis effort. Some believed that entire episode raised the issue of trust with Akinci. During the election campaign, negative views about the negotiation framework were expressed by several Greek Cypriot presidential candidates who questioned the continuation of the goal of a bizonal, bicommunal, federal solution. Many in the north who once looked favorably on Anastasiades's efforts to seek a solution began to feel that the Turkish Cypriot government had failed to reach an agreement. The last meeting between Anastasiades and Eroglu was held on April 16, 2003. Some believed that the Turkish Cypriot government had failed to reach an agreement with the Greek Cypriot government.

Thus, if the bills were enacted, silencers would not be subject to the NFA's tax and registration requirements but would still be subject to all GCA firearm regulations. To combat this perception, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule in 2016 that expressly allows specified state entities to report limited information otherwise covered by HIPAA to NICS or to another entity that reports to NICS. As noted above, Congress has also sought to improve mental health record reporting at the state level through NIAA, which (among other things) funds state efforts to develop systems for accurate and complete reporting. NICS reporting of mental health records at the federal level has raised somewhat different issues. Although federal agencies are generally required to report mental health adjudication records for background check purposes, NIAA makes clear that federal departments and agencies may not furnish such records. For example, a prosecutor may prove a knowing violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)—the GCA provision that bars felons from possessing firearms—by establishing only that the defendant knew that he possessed a firearm but not that he knew of his status as a felon at the time he possessed the firearm.

  "\" was an institutional injury, the court determined that, although the Member plaintiffs had a \"stronger case\" for standing than the plaintiffs had in Raines, historical practice, a lack of congressional authorization, and the availability of alternative remedies demonstrated that the injury was too \"wholly abstract\" and \"widely dispersed\" to confer standing on an individual Member. These cases make clear that the difference between a \"personal\" and an \"institutional injury\" does not hinge on the issue of particularization. Rather, the difference is the source of the right that has been violated. The Seven-Member Rule cases demonstrate that, even where an injury has a particular effect on certain Members, it can nonetheless be insufficiently \"concrete\" under Raines if the Member's injury does not deprive him of something to which he is personally entitled. In other words, where the right alleged to have been violated is tied to a right granted to a plaintiff \"as [a] Member[] of Congress,\" all of Congress is harmed equally, as a diminution of that right affects the institution as a whole.

Despite these provisions, the extent of NFS areas in need of treatment has continued to increase, and FS continues to look for ways to increase the pace of project implementation. To some, this implies that the HFRA approach to streamline agency decisionmaking has not been successful. The law established two new programs for FS (watershed condition framework and water source protection), and amended three existing programs: the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP, available only for FS), stewardship contracting authority, and the good neighbor authority.

Using a different approach, but reaching the same ultimate result, the Eighth Circuit in United States v. Bena concluded at step one of its analysis that § 922(g)(8) is constitutional on its face, reasoning that \"[i]nsofar as § 922(g)(8) prohibits possession of firearms by those who are found to represent a 'credible threat to the physical safety of [an] intimate partner or child... it is consistent with a common-law tradition that the right to bear arms is limited to peaceable or virtuous citizens.\" Additionally, in an as-applied challenge, the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Mahin upheld the conviction of a person subject to a domestic violence protective order who had been found in violation of § 922(g)(8) by renting a firearm at a shooting range. The court rejected the defendant's argument that it would be in error to overlook sixty-five years of unchanged Supreme Court precedent and the deluge of evidence that the Second Amendment is constitutional.

Beginning with the operative clause, the Supreme Court first concluded that the phrase the \"right of the people,\" as used in the Bill of Rights, universally communicates an individual right, and thus the Second Amendment protects a right that is \"exercised individually and belongs to all Americans.\" Next, the Court turned to the meaning of \"to keep and bear arms.\" \"Arms,\" the Court said, has the same meaning now as it did during the eighteenth century: \"any",

  ". biomedical research. NIH Director Francis Collins announced an investigation of research institutions for undue foreign influence in three key areas: First, failure by some researchers at NIH-funded institutions to disclose substantial contributions of resources from other organizations, including foreign governments, which threatens to distort decisions about the appropriate use of NIH funds. Second, diversion of intellectual property and grant applications [that] are produced by NIH-supported biomedical research to other entities, including other countries. And third, failure by some peer reviewers to keep information on grant applications confidential, including in some instances disclosure to foreign entities or other attempts to influence funding decisions. Dr. Collins also announced a working group of university leaders to develop methods and policies that mitigate undue foreign influence. Despite the presence of bad actors, Collins stressed the important role that foreign scientists have played in U.S.-funded research and reasserted the NIH's commitment to \"preserve the vibrancy of the diverse workforce.\" Another partnership, the Biomarkers Consortium, aims to identify promising biomarkers for disease and treatment and includes the NIH, FDA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA NIH also funds a limited amount of clinical research on new or existing pharmaceuticals to assess drug safety and effectiveness.

  "Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services to certain individuals under 65. Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services to certain individuals under 65 (the disabled and persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)), and introduced managed care into Medicare by allowing private insurance entities to provide Medicare benefits in exchange for a monthly capitated payment. This law also began to place limitations on the definitions of reasonable costs and charges in order to gain some control over program spending which, even initially, exceeded original projections. During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of laws were enacted that included provisions designed to further stem the rapid increase in program spending through modifications to the way payments to providers were determined, and to postpone the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund. This was typically achieved through tightening rules governing payments to providers of services and limiting the annual updates in such payments. The program moved from payments based on reasonable costs and reasonable charges to payment systems under which a predetermined payment amount was established for a specified unit of service. At the same time, beneficiaries were given expanded options to obtain covered services through private managed care arrangements, typically health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Most Medicare payment provisions were incorporated into larger budget reconciliation bills designed to control overall federal spending. This effort culminated in the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 2013.

During the visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a long-term plan to promote the development of China-Cuba ties. He said that China would welcome Cuba's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative, which is focused on infrastructure development around the world. President Xi called on both countries to enhance cooperation on trade, energy, agriculture, tourism, and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. While Cuba's relationship with China undoubtedly has an ideological component since both are the among the world's remaining communist regimes, economic linkages and cooperation appear to be the most significant component of bilateral relations. According to Cuban trade statistics, total Cuba-China trade in 2017 was valued at almost $7 million (accounting for 16.1% of Cuba's trade worldwide), instead of the $1.9 billion certified by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

  "(William L. Painter; February 28, 2019) Congress amended the Disaster Relief Act (DRRA) to help local governments manage acute tax and other revenue loss after a disaster, which could inhibit their ability to adequately serve their communities during recovery. Several factors compromise the authoritativeness of any answer to this question. One such complication is the lack of a consensus definition of what constitutes home land security, and another is that homeland security activities are carried out across the federal government, in partnership with other public and private sector entities. When apprehensions decline, whether it is due to fewer illegal entrants getting caught or fewer attempting to enter illegally is not known. Other difficulties include measuring the contribution of any single border security component in isolation from the others, assessing the extent to which enforcement actions deter illegal crossing attempts, and evaluating ongoing enforcement efforts outside of border-specific actions and their impact on border security. Section 1092 of the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide annual metrics on border security that are intended to help address some of the challenges of measuring the impact of border security.

  "The idea of a single term for Presidents, rather than the two-term tradition, enjoyed support as an appropriate norm for executive tenure, both by design and circumstance. From the standpoint of amending the Constitution to limit Presidents to a single term, Jackson himself recommended that Congress consider an amendment that would establish a single four- or six-year presidential term in his Annual Messages to Congress in 1835. William Henry Harrison (1841) recommended a constitutional amendment to prohibit \"the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the Presidency\" in his 1841 inaugural address, while his Whig Party called for \"a single term for the presidency\" three years later in 1844, in its first published presidential platform. Although similar declarations do not appear in the Democratic platforms of the time, historian Michael Nelson notes that many Democrats supported the proposal; moreover, Democratic Presidents James Polk (1845-1849) and James Buchanan (1857-1861) announced their intention to serve only one term.

  "8 million acre-feet and have more than doubled since 1970. The use of Conservation Operation funding for WFPO activities has continued each fiscal year through the FY2019 appropriations. This congressionally directed amount is in addition to the $150 million made available for the program as a whole in FY2019. Dams constructed under the WFPO program are eligible to receive assistance under the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program, authorized by Congress in 2000. This title also authorized Reclamation to undertake specific and general feasibility studies for reclamation wastewater and reuse projects and to research, construct, and operate demonstration projects. Even so, these projects remain a small part of the overall Reclamation portfolio. Historically, Reclamation constructed projects with federal funds, then established a repayment schedule based on the amount of total construction costs allocated to specific project purposes. The key practical difference is that with the individual project authorizations there is no predictable assistance, or even guarantee of funding after a project is authorized, because funding must be secured each year in the congressional appropriations process. However, Congress, in passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1954, P.L. 83-566, as amended, 68 Stat. 905 (33 U.S.C. 701b-1); and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954, P.L. 83-566, as amended, 68 Stat. 666 (16 U.S.C. 1001-1008). Regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. §35.3500. In addition to the individual project authorizations, the federal funds for funding were, initially, those needed for constructing or upgrading (and planning and designing) publicly owned municipal wastewater treatment plans. As defined in Clean Water Act Section 212, devices and systems used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal sewage are eligible. These include construction or upgrading of secondary or advanced treatment plants; construction of new collector sewers, interceptor sewers, or storm sewers; and projects to correct existing problems of sewer system rehabilitation, infiltration/inflow of sewer lines, and combined sewer overflows. Operation and maintenance are not eligible activities. All funds in the clean water SRF resulting from federal capitalization grants are first to be used to assure compliance with enforceable deadlines, goals, and requirements of the act, including municipal compliance.

Global trends in economics, demographics, resources, and climate change portend an increased demand for maritime presence, power, and influence. America's prosperity depends on the seas… and as disruption and disorder persist in our security environment, maritime activity will evolve and expand.

  ", Labor, and State, and the Trade and Development Agency. The Constitution empowers Congress to set tariffs—a customs duty levied on imports and exports; this power has been partially delegated to the President. While historically tariffs were used as a primary means of collecting government revenue, today developed countries like the United States rely on other means for generating revenue. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) administers the collection of tariffs at U.S. ports of entry—in 2016, CBP collected $32 billion in tariffs, just 1% of total federal revenue. Over the past 80 years, the United States used its tariff policy to encourage global trade liberalization toward various ends, such as increasing global trade, supporting global peace and economic prosperity, and opening markets for U.S. exports. Toward these ends, the United States has reduced or eliminated many of its tariffs through bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations and agreements (see above). Beginning in 1934, Congress began periodically authorizing the President to impose a four-year safeguard measure on imports of solar cells and a three-year safeguard measure on large residential washing machines (see Figure 9 ). From a broad perspective of the U.S. economy as a whole, trade is one of a number of forces that drive changes in employment, wages, and productivity.

Historically, U.S. trade policy has focused on supporting economic growth and jobs through trade, liberalizing markets by reducing trade and investment barriers through trade agreements and negotiations, enforcing trade commitments and related laws, and providing time-limited relief to companies and workers facing unfair or injurious import competition. Another key objective of U.S. trade policy has been to advance U.S. strategic goals by supporting economic development and integration of developing countries, strengthening regional alliances, and extending U.S. influence abroad. U.S. trade policy has supported the development of global value chains by multinational corporations (MNCs), which source production globally.

  "breaker. The committee estimates the rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost of the first heavy icebreaker to be $983 million. (See Appendix D, Table D-6.) The ship would be outfitted with oceanographic overboarding equipment and instrumentation and facilities comparable with those of modern oceanographic research vessels. Some basic scientific capability, such as hydrographic mapping sonar, should be acquired at the time of the build of each ship so that environmental data that are essential in fulfilling USCG polar missions can be collected. If policymakers decide to procure a second new medium polar icebreaker or a third new medium polar icebreaker, the same general approach recommended by the NASEM report could be followed—a second medium polar icebreaker and third medium polar icebreaker could be built to the same common design used for the three new heavy polar icebreakers and the first new medium polar icebreaker. The Coast Guard's strategy document for the Arctic region, released on May 21, 2013, states that \"The United States must have adequate icebreaking capability to support research that advances fundamental understanding of the region and its evolution,\" and that \"The Nation must also make a strategic investment in icebreaking capability to enable access to the high latitudes over the long-term.\" A separate CRS report covers acquisition of general-purpose cutters for the Coast Guard.

  "'s Title IX Coordinator. This would bar the practice of some universities that have used a single investigator to both examine allegations and reach a decision regarding culpability. And in contrast to past guidance from ED, the new regulations permit schools to apply either a preponderance of the evidence standard or a clear and convincing standard. However, schools may apply the former only if they use that same standard for conduct violations other than sexual harassment that carry the same maximum disciplinary penalty. Further, schools must apply the same standard of evidence for complaints against students as it does for employees and faculty. A schools may, but is not required to, allow appeals of decisions. If it does so, it must allow both parties to appeal. The private right of action currently available under Title IX is one of judicial implication—that is, the Court has interpreted the statute to imply such a right, in the absence of express statutory language providing for it. If the \"school, upon notice of the harassment, responds by taking prompt and effective action to end the harassment and prevent its recurrence, the school has carried out its responsibility under the Title IX regulations.\" Though framed as guidance, the 1997 and 2001 Guidance explained that \"it should take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate or otherwise determine what occurred in the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct.

Rather, under Davis, a recipient's response to harassment will amount to deliberate indifference only if it is \" clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\" Because this standard is not \"a mere standard,\" courts have often ruled in favor of due process challenges. For instance, the Supreme Court in Davis found that a recipient's response to sexual abuse or harassment did not violate due process. The property interests protected by the Due Process Clause are",
  ". DOE issued an environmental assessment on January 17, 2019, that found no significant environmental impact from fabricating the fuel at existing INL facilities. The U.S. advanced nuclear industry has expanded in recent years to encompass an array of developers, suppliers, and supporting institutions. By one count, there were 35 U.S. companies developing advanced nuclear reactor technologies as of November 2018. Some have projected that the first U.S. advanced reactor could be providing electricity to the grid by the mid-2020s. Some have projected that the first U.S. advanced reactor could be providing electricity to the grid by the mid-2020s. There are currently 98 operating U.S. reactors. As aging reactors reach the end of their operating licenses in 2030 and beyond, the number of retirements is projected to increase. A report by MIT estimates that 17%-19% (or 134-151 GWt) of the U.S. market for industrial heat could be supplied by small (150-300 MWt) advanced reactors. The report also noted that \"proliferation resistance and ease to verify (safeguardability) are not interchangeable; and most of the features of advanced reactors are not interchangeable.\" The report also noted that the U.S. market for industrial heat is not as large as the U.S. market for nuclear power. The International Framework on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC) is an international body dedicated to ensuring that \"proliferation resistance and ease to verify (safeguardability) are not interchangeable; and most of the features of advanced reactors are not interchangeable.\" The report also noted that the U.S. market for industrial heat is not as large as the U.S. market for nuclear power. The 65 million appropriated for R&D to support development of a versatile fast test reactor, also called the versatile test reactor; Material Recovery and Waste Form Development : $38 million appropriated to activities related to \"the improvement of the current back end of the nuclear cycle [waste management and reprocessing],\" of which $27 million were specifically directed towards activities supporting advanced nuclear technologies. In addition to the programs that focus exclusively on advanced reactor R&D, several cross-cutting NE programs directly or indirectly support advanced nuclear technologies. NE's Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) program includes several subprograms focused on cross-cutting research to support both existing and advanced nuclear technologies.

The conference report also stated that OTs can serve as an efficient way for all members to send unsolicited technology suggestions and solutions to solve a defined challenge. Consortia can also be used to develop an ecosystem of entities working together on a project, whereby members of a consortium pool resources and collaborate with DOD. A number of analysts argue that using consortia in this way gives the federal government a unique ability to leverage and pool the technological expertise and innovation of multiple entities in a particular sector, thereby strengthening and advancing a sector of the industrial base that may have defense applications. This report examines (1) how OTs work, (2) why they were established, (3) potential benefits and risks of using OTs, and (4) whether there are data available against which to measure their effectiveness. Appendix A provides a legislative history of DOD's other transaction authorities. In recent years, DOD should seek to foster more collaboration in consortia. Some analysts have argued that consortia reduce competition, since only members of the consortium under contract can participate in the project or submit white papers for consideration and funding. Others counter that even when an OT is signed with a single consortium, competition could be increased, since all members of the consortium under contract can participate in the project or submit white papers for consideration and funding.

(Also see \" Colombia \" section below.) U.S. support to combat drug trafficking and reduce crime also has included a series of partnerships with other countries in the region: the Mérida Initiative, which has led to improved bilateral security cooperation with Mexico; the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI); and the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI). Under the Obama Administration, those initiatives combined U.S. antidrug and rule-of-law assistance with economic development and violence prevention programs intended to improve citizen security in the region. The Trump Administration's approach to Latin America and the Caribbean has focused heavily on U.S. policy toward the region. In 2017, the United States, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, and the United States, the Caribbean, and the United States, respectively. President Vizcarra is continuing the same types of market-friendly economic policies as his predecessors. The Trump Administration has maintained the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America while seeking to enact some significant changes in U.S. policy toward the region. In March 2018, Peru and the other 10 signatories of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (minus the United States, which withdrew in 2017) signed a new trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Vizcarra is continuing the same types of market-friendly economic policies as his recent predecessors. The Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that Peru's economic growth was 3.7 The U.S. Congress is expected to review the agreement before it can enter into force. In Central America, a potential oversight issue is the effectiveness of U.S. assistance to the Northern Triangle countries related to efforts to combat insecurity, corruption, and human rights violations; of particular concern are efforts to undermine anticorruption efforts in Guatemala and Honduras, especially the Guatemalan president's action against the U.N.-backed CICIG. Congress also potentially could consider immigration legislation related to the termination of TPS for Nicaragua, Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras and the rescission of DACA. Early in 2018, the IMF had forecast 1.9% regional growth for the year. However, Venezuela's continued economic decline and persistent economic challenges in several countries lowered growth.

In addition, the Administration is currently withholding approval for judge appointments to the WTO Appellate Body—a practice that began under the Obama Administration. While many of the U.S. concerns are not new and are shared by other trading partners, questions remain about U.S. priorities for improving the system. The Trump Administration has stated a preference for negotiating bilateral FTAs, rather than multiparty agreements. In September 2018, the United States, Mexico, and Canada completed negotiations of the proposed USMCA, which revamps the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The United States and South Korea also agreed to some modifications of their bilateral FTA. In addition, USTR notified Congress of its intent to begin trade negotiations with the EU, Japan, and the UK. These divisions have called into question the viability of the \"single undertaking,\" or one-package approach in future multilateral negotiations and suggest broader need for institutional reform if the WTO is to remain a relevant negotiating body.

(See \" Lead-Up to Maduro's January 2019 Inauguration and Aftermath,\" below.) Based on conservative figures from UNHCR and other experts, more than 3 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants had left the country by November 2018, with the vast majority remaining in the Latin America and Caribbean region. As of November 2018, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that there were over 1 million Venezuelans living in Colombia, 500,000 in Peru, 220,000 in Ecuador 130,000 in Argentina, 100,000 in Chile, 94,000 in Panama, and 85,000 in Brazil.

Venezuela's currency-control system requires individuals and firms to purchase hard currency from the government's currency commission at a fixed exchange rate, which has created incentives for trade-based money laundering. Critics caution there is a lack of evidence to conclude that the Venezuelan government has \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,\" as required by law. In 1989, Venezuela's National Assembly declared that President Maduro had usurped the presidency. The legislature also established a framework for the formation of a transitional government led by Juan Guaidó of the Popular Will (VP) party, the president of the National Assembly who was elected With a simple majority, the legislature can approve or reject the budget and the issuing of debt, remove ministers and the vice president from office, overturn enabling laws that give the president decree powers, and appoint the 5 members of the CNE (for 7-year terms) and the 32 members of the Supreme Court (for one 12-year term). With a two-thirds majority, the assembly can remove judges, submit laws directly to a popular referendum, and convene a constitutional assembly to revise the constitution.

  ". public opinion regarding the U.S. role in the world. The foregoing covers only some of the more prominent arguments and counterarguments in the debate over the future U.S. role in the world. In fact, younger Americans are more inclined to support cooperative approaches to US foreign policy and more likely to feel favorably towards trade and globalization. As discussed later in this report, however, the costs and benefits for the United States might affect the U.S. role in the world, particularly in terms of defending and promoting democracy and criticizing and resisting authoritarian and illiberal forms of government. During the Cold War—a period that featured an ongoing ideological competition between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the relative merits of Western-style democracy and Soviet-style governance—the effective operation of U.S. democracy at the federal level and lower levels was viewed as helpful for arguing on the world stage that Western-style democracy was superior, for encouraging other countries to adopt that model, and for inspiring people in the Soviet Union and other authoritarian countries to resist authoritarian and illiberal forms of government.

  ". While the issue largely remains an open question in the courts, the First Amendment may provide some protection for social media companies when they make content presentation decisions, limiting the federal government's ability to regulate those decisions. The extent of any free speech protections will depend on how courts view social media companies and the specific action being regulated. Accordingly, the bulk of this report explores how the First Amendment applies to social media providers' content presentation decisions. Looking to three possible analogues drawn from existing First Amendment law, the report explores whether social media companies could be viewed in the same way as company executives, lawyers, or other public officials, and whether they could be viewed in the same way as government officials, lawyers, or other public officials. The report also explains the possible regulatory implications of each First Amendment framework as Congress considers the novel legal issues raised by the regulation of social media. Under current federal law, social media users may face at least two significant barriers if they attempt to sue a social media provider for its decisions about hosting or limiting access to users' content. The first, which likely applies only to lawsuits predicated on a platform's decision to remove rather than allow content, is the state action requirement of the First Amendment. The state action doctrine provides that constitutional free speech protections generally apply only when a person is harmed by an action of the government, rather than a private party. The Supreme Court has held that the state action requirement of the First Amendment does not apply to social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube.
