  "Part of the Mariana Islands Archipelago, the CNMI is a chain of 14 islands in the western Pacific Ocean, just north of Guam and about 3,200 miles west of Hawaii. The CNMI has a total population of 53,890, according to the CNMI’s 2016 Household, Income, and Expenditures Survey. Almost 90 percent of the population (48,200) resided on the island of Saipan, with an additional 6 percent (3,056) on the island of Tinian and 5 percent (2,635) on the island of Rota. The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS exercises parole authority to allow, on a case-by-case basis, eligible nationals of China to enter the CNMI temporarily as tourists when there is significant public benefit, according to DHS. Following consecutive annual decreases in the total number of employed workers from 2005 through 2013, employment has increased annually since 2014, according to CNMI tax data. Figure 4 shows the numbers of employed workers, both foreign and domestic, in the CNMI from 2001 through 2016. From 2013 to 2016, the number of employed workers increased by approximately 25 percent, from 23,344 to 29,215. As figure 4 shows, while the number and percentage of foreign workers fell between 2001 and 2016, foreign workers still constitute the majority of the CNMI workforce. Of the nearly 30,000 employed workers in the CNMI in 2016, more than half were foreign workers, according to CNMI tax data. The CNMI is a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the number of CW-1 permits almost doubled, and since fiscal year 2016, the number of permits has approached the numerical limits on permits for those years. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the number of permits approved for workers born in the Philippines, who received the most permits for all 7 years of the CW program, had declined by 13 percent from fiscal year 2012 to more than 13,000 in fiscal year 2016. Under the terms of S. 2325, the number of permits issued may not exceed 13,000 during fiscal year 2017. Starting in fiscal year 2020, the number of permits issued may not exceed a number that is 500 fewer than the number issued during the immediately preceding fiscal year. Figure 1 shows the past and future numerical limits on CNMI-Only Transitional Worker permits established by DHS and the proposed numerical limits for permits under S. 2325. The limits shown for S. 2325 in figure 1 assume that employers would petition for, and DHS would issue, the maximum number of available permits for fiscal year 2019 and for each subsequent year. Under S. 2325, as of January 26, 2018, fiscal year 2018 petitions were still being adjudicated. Our preliminary analysis of USCIS CW-1 permit data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 identified trends in CW-1 workers’ country of birth, occupation, and duration of employment. USCIS data showed a decline in the numbers of CW-1 permits for fiscal years 2017 through 2018 for workers born in each of the five countries listed most frequently on the petitions—the Philippines, China, South Korea, Bangladesh, and Japan (see table 3). As of January 17, 2018, the number of permits approved for workers born in the Philippines, who received the most permits for all 7 years of the CW program, had declined by 13 percent from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018 and by 26 percent from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018. Concurrent with construction of the casino and other tourism infrastructure, the number of CW-1 permits for workers born in China increased by almost 3,800 from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016 and declined by about 3,500 from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018. Table 2 shows the CW-3 permits could be renewed in 3-year increments during the transition period for workers who remain outside the United States",
  ". GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. PHMSA officials also told us that intrastate pipelines pose the highest safety risk to states and, consequently, state pipeline safety agencies should focus their efforts on intrastate pipeline oversight rather than participating in interstate pipeline inspections. During the last 7 years, four states that applied for an agent agreement— New Hampshire, Virginia, Maryland, and Nevada—were not accepted by PHMSA for these reasons. (See app. I.) In 2013, PHMSA decided not to renew another state pipeline safety agency’s interstate agent agreement, citing the state agency’s inability to staff its program properly, among other things. While temporary interstate agreements provide an opportunity to participate in interstate pipeline oversight, PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agents to develop an annual inspection plan. Unlike the previous analysis, PHMSA’s interstate pipeline safety agency is responsible for conducting interstate pipeline inspections. In addition, PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agencies to develop an annual inspection plan. Unlike the previous analysis, the regional workload analysis takes into account federal inspector workload, pipeline construction, and the amount of pipeline inspections. PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agencies to develop an annual inspection plan. In addition, PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agencies to develop an annual inspection plan. At the federal level, PHMSA is responsible for developing regulations for domestic interstate and intrastate pipeline inspections. In the event PHMSA requested assistance with certain interstate inspections, state inspectors may be unfamiliar with the interstate pipeline systems and operators. As a result, some state officials said that their inspectors may have a steep learning curve when conducting inspections under a temporary interstate agreement. Instead, PHMSA’s regional offices and states are responsible for inspecting nearly 3,000 companies that operate 2.7 million miles of pipelines. Each year, PHMSA uses its Risk Ranking Index Model (RRIM) as one input to determine its annual inspection priorities. While PHMSA has improved how it allocates its current inspection staff among the regions, the agency lacks a forward-looking workforce plan for interstate pipeline inspections. During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. Some violations, including the four illustrative examples below, were deemed serious enough that PHMSA imposed civil penalties. In 2015, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state. During the inspection, Connecticut inspectors found the pipeline operator had failed to employ properly qualified welders in constructing a section of the pipeline. As a result, PHMSA issued a civil penalty of $26,200 to the pipeline operator. In 2016, PHMSA offered to enter into a longer-term, temporary interstate agreement, which would permit the state agency to inspect the installation of two large interstate pipeline systems. The state agency accepted the temporary interstate agreement, which may be extended annually until the completion of the pipeline construction. In 2014, the New York Department of Public Service’s Pipeline Division inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state. During that inspection, New York inspectors identified violations related to the operator’s corrosion-control practices. Inspectors also found that the operator failed to prepare, and follow, a manual for conducting operations and maintenance activities, as well as for emergency response. As a result, PHMSA issued a civil penalty of $61,900. In response to the findings, the operator took action to address the corrosion control-related violations and revised its operations and maintenance manual. In 2011, the New York Department of Public Service’s Pipeline Division inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state. During that inspection, a New York inspector identified violations related to corrosion-control practices. As a result, PHMSA agreed with the recommendation and the state has no plans to reapply. Nevada: Nevada’s pipeline safety agency applied for interstate agent status in 2011. According to state pipeline safety officials, these agencies assume inspection responsibilities for the range of interstate inspection activities, as agreed upon by PHMSA and prioritized by PHMSA during the agency’s annual inspection planning process. States may also propose and conduct additional inspections as they believe necessary. While state inspectors can identify violations, PHMSA is ultimately responsible for enforcement of interstate pipeline regulations and uses a range of enforcement tools from Warning Letters to more stringent Notices of Probable Violation with either proposed compliance orders or proposed civil penalties. Temporary interstate agreement: These agreements allow PHMSA to request a state that has had its certification validated by PHMSA to perform interstate pipeline inspections on a temporary basis. According to PHMSA guidelines, these agreements are used typically for new construction inspections, but may include assistance such as inspection of specific operators, witness to repairs or testing, or investigation of incidents. Since 2010, PHMSA has entered into temporary interstate agreements. Since 2010, PHMSA has entered into",
  "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress in the implementation of the VistA Evolution program, including costs for development, operation and maintenance, and payroll for government employees over the 3 fiscal years. VA’s goal is for all instances of VistA being used in its medical facilities to be standardized where practical. Such standardization is intended to better position the department to switch to the Cerner system. To increase standardization, the VistA Evolution program has been focused over the last 5 years on standardizing a core set of VistA modules related to interoperability which, according to the department, accounts for about 60 percent of VistA. The plans are to be reviewed during the milestone reviews identified in the department’s formal project management framework. In addition, the program has focused on identifying software that is common to each VistA instance. VA refers to this collection of standard software as the gold instance. As part of its effort to standardize VistA, VA has implemented a process to compare the system at each site with the gold instance. Sites that are identified as having variations from the gold instance must apply for a waiver to gain approval for continuing to operate a non-standard VistA instance. These factors remain relevant today and can serve as a model of best practices that VA could apply to enhance the likelihood that the acquisition of a new electronic health record system will be successfully achieved. Among the agencies’ seven IT investments, agency officials identified nine factors as having been critical to the success of three or more of the seven investments. These nine critical success factors are consistent with leading industry practices for IT acquisition. The factors are: Active engagement of senior officials with stakeholders. Qualified and experienced program staff. Support of senior department and agency executives. Involvement of senior department and agency executives. Involvement of end users and stakeholders in the development of requirements. Participation of end users in testing system functionality prior to formal end user acceptance testing. Consistency and stability of government and contractor staff. Prioritization of requirements by program staff. Prioritization of requirements by program staff. Prioritization of requirements by program staff. In the absence of a complete definition of VistA, VistA modules are comprised of one or more software applications that support various health care functions, such as providing care coordination and mental health services. In addition to VistA, the department has taken a number of steps to define the system’s scope and identify the components that the Cerner system will replace. These steps have included conducting two analyses, performing preliminary site assessments, and planning for Cerner to perform a detailed assessment of each site where the new system will be deployed. In addition, officials from two investments noted that actively engaging with stakeholders created transparency and trust, and increased the support from the stakeholders. Additionally, officials for six of the seven selected investments indicated that the knowledge and skills of the program staff were critical to the success of the program. This included knowledge of acquisitions and procurement processes, monitoring of contracts, large-scale organizational transformation, Agile software development concepts, and areas of program management such as earned value management and technical monitoring. Finally, officials for five of the seven selected investments identified having the end users test and validate the system components prior to formal end user acceptance testing for deployment as critical to the success of their program. In addition, to support the program office, the department has awarded a contract for project management support and has also reassigned a number of VA staff to the PEO. Further, VA has drafted a memorandum that describes the role of governance bodies within VA, as well as governance intended to facilitate coordination between DOD and VA. For example, according to the draft memorandum, the department combined data from the VA Systems Inventory, the VistA Document Library, the VA Monograph, and other sources to identify the components that the department will replace. The resulting analysis of VA’s health IT environment identified a total of 330 applications that support health care delivery at a medical center, of which 119 applications (approximately 36 percent) have been identified as having similar functionality as a capability of the Cerner system. Additionally, according to EHRM program documentation, VA is in the process of establishing a Functional Governance Board (FGC) that will be responsible for the implementation of VistA. The FGC will be responsible for the implementation of VistA. The FGC will be responsible for the implementation of VistA. The FGC will",

NASA’s request for a March to June 2019 launch window was driven by its own schedule and technical issues, but also avoids potential conflicts with other mission launches. According to project officials, the delay allows the project to shift some of the work to prepare OTIS for integration with the spacecraft element. When complete, the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The hardware configuration created when the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module were integrated, referred to as OTIS, is expected to arrive at Northrop Grumman months ahead of its need date for integration into the observatory. According to program officials, a workmanship error contributed to the tears. The tears can be repaired; however, some schedule reserve may be required to repair them. Additionally, during the deployment exercise, one of the sunshield’s six membrane tensioning systems experienced a snag. Northrop Grumman reported 496 full-time equivalent staff in September 2017, or 387 more than planned. According to JWST project officials and similar to previous years, Northrop Grumman’s priority for fiscal year 2018 is to maintain schedule in order to reduce risk for challenging environmental tests on flight hardware. These tests allowed the project and its contractors to ensure that the new launch window set from March to June 2019 can be met. As a result, Northrop Grumman’s contractor workforce levels are expected to continue to be elevated through JWST’s final integration and test phase in fiscal year 2019 where the spacecraft and OTIS will be integrated before shipment to the launch site. In these prior reports, we have made recommendations with regard to improving cost and schedule estimating, updating risk assessments, and strengthening management oversight. NASA has generally agreed and taken steps to implement a number of our recommendations. For example, in December 2015, we recommended that the JWST project require contractors to identify, explain, and document anomalies in contractor-delivered monthly earned value management reports. The project has also progressed in preparing the software and ground systems that will operate the observatory and manage and control the telescope’s observations. According to NASA’s Independent Verification and Validation group, the overall status of JWST software development and integration efforts is very positive with minimal development remaining, and the group has significant confidence that the mission software will support the mission objectives. Additionally, the remaining 3.5 months of previously planned schedule reserves was consumed as a result of the contractor having underestimated the time required to complete integration and test work on the spacecraft and other risks identified in the schedule risk analysis. Specifically, execution of spacecraft integration and test tasks, due to the complexity of work and cautious handling given sensitivity of flight hardware, was slower than planned. In December 2016, we reported that the project maintained a risk list with 73 items. Currently, the list of tracked risks has 47 items to be closed or mitigated to acceptable levels. According to Northrop Grumman officials, the sunshield is elevated off the ground for installation work and the size and quantity of the work lifts necessary for the technicians to access the sunshield requires more maneuvering and prevents the technicians from working on the forward and aft sunshield assemblies simultaneously. Taking into account the consumption of planned reserves and the establishment of the revised launch window, the project expected to have up to 4 months of schedule reserve extending to the end of the launch window range, or June 2019. However, shortly after the project notified ESA of the launch delay in September 2017",

The National 911 Program is unable to assess how well its activities are achieving results in relation to its responsibilities identified in the 2012 Act. As the National 911 Program, an NG911 system should have the capability to, among other things: provide a secure environment for emergency communications; acquire and integrate additional data for routing and answering calls; process all types of emergency calls, including multimedia messages; transfer calls with added data to other call centers or first responders. While NG911 systems must possess certain capabilities, it is important to note that states and localities may make decisions about which capabilities they intend to use to achieve NG911 transition. According to NHTSA officials, the cost study will present a nationwide view, rather than a state-by-state view, on the progress of NG911 implementation and its associated costs. This initiative will convene the 911 stakeholder community to identify national-level tasks that need to be completed by federal agencies and other organizations to realize a national, interconnected NG911 system. According to a panel of experts convened by the National 911 Program, a list of proposed rulemaking outlining implementing regulations for the grant program. In a separate effort, an advisory body tasked by FCC to examine 911 call center architecture issued a report in 2016 that provides a cybersecurity self- assessment tool for call centers and guidance on cybersecurity strategies. Description of challenge States may face a range of challenges related to evolving roles for state and local 911 authorities that could hinder NG911 implementation. These technical and operational changes may also have effects on 911 funding and state and local governance structures, which we will discuss in more detail later in this report. According to an FCC advisory body that examined NG911 systems architecture in 2016, while NG911 systems are implemented in a variety of ways at the state or local level, NG911 implementation can occur gradually and in phases. In 2016, the information obtained from our case studies provides examples of broader issues faced by states and localities in managing the NG911 transition. To determine how federal agencies have addressed state and local implementation challenges and planned next steps, we reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and documentation of federal agency actions and plans, and our prior reports. We also interviewed officials from federal agencies, including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), FCC, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), about federal agencies",

In particular, CMS had shown a commitment to combating fraud, in part, by establishing a dedicated entity—the Center for Program Integrity—to lead antifraud efforts, and offering and requiring antifraud training for stakeholder groups, such as providers, beneficiaries, and health-insurance plans; and taken steps to identify fraud risks, such as by designating specific provider types as high risk and developing associated control activities. In January 2016, CMS had not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicaid, and had not designed and implemented a risk-based antifraud strategy. A fraud risk assessment allows managers to fully consider fraud risks to their programs, analyze their likelihood and impact, and prioritize risks. We found that federal spending on Medicaid programs could be reduced by billions of dollars if HHS were required to improve the process for reviewing, approving, and making transparent the basis for spending limits approved for Medicaid demonstrations. In August 2017, we reported that the partnership participants separately told us the HFPP’s studies helped them identify and take action against potentially fraudulent providers and payment vulnerabilities of which they might not otherwise have been aware, and fostered both formal and informal information sharing. As a result, in December 2017 we made three recommendations to CMS, including the need for more complete and accurate reporting, criteria for economical and efficient payments, and written guidance on the distribution of payments. The T-MSIS initiative has the potential to improve CMS’s ability to identify improper payments, help ensure beneficiaries’ access to services, and improve program transparency, among other benefits. As we reported in December 2017, implementing the T-MSIS initiative has been—and will continue to be—a multi-year effort. CMS has worked closely with states and has reached a point where nearly all states are reporting T-MSIS data. As we have previously reported, CMS has made changes to its Medicaid program integrity efforts, including a shift to collaborative audits—in which CMS’s contractors and states work in partnership to audit Medicaid providers. In March 2017, we reported that CMS has identified substantial potential overpayments to providers, but barriers",

We use table 3.3 of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)—State and Local Government Current Receipts and Expenditures—prepared by BEA at the U.S. Department of Commerce as an organizing framework for developing our model of the state and local government sector. For a given year, we used the model to simulate the level of total expenditures that would keep the operating balance greater than or equal to zero. We then calculated the difference between the present value of total expenditures simulated assuming the sector maintains balance, and the present value of real pension benefits paid to state and local governments, and the total present value of state and local government employees’ pension contributions. Then, we calculated the difference between revenues and expenditures assuming the sector maintains current policies, and as a percentage of the present value of U.S. GDP. We calculated all of the present values for the 50-year period from 2018 through 2067, and we used a discount rate equal to the average of the total present value of state and local government employees’ pension contributions, and the value of assets in state and local government defined benefit pension funds in 2017. This suggests that state and local governments may need to take additional steps to manage their pension obligations by reducing benefits or increasing employees’ contributions.

F-22 units are likely to continue to experience aircraft availability and pilot training rates that are below what they could be. F-22 pilots are not meeting their minimum yearly training requirements for the air superiority missions. F-22 pilots need extensive training for F-22 units to fulfill their air superiority role. The Air Force has a comprehensive assessment of the F-22 organizational structure that identifies and assesses alternative approaches to organizing F-22 squadrons. The Air Force also plans to use more durable materials to make long-term corrective repairs beginning in calendar year 2019, but this will constitute a costly long-term effort, according to the Air Force. As a result of the F-22 fleet’s small size and resulting low demand for parts, the Air Force faces a number of supply challenges that have contributed to reduced and unpredictable aircraft availability. The Air Force identified a requirement for 381 F-22s in 2002, but ended aircraft production in 2012 with approximately half of that number. The Air Force identified a number of mission-capable aircraft to this mission, which is more challenging for squadrons with a smaller number of aircraft. The Air Force officials emphasized that the requirements outlined in the Ready Aircrew Program are minimums and noted that some pilots may need additional sorties to achieve proficiency. The total aircraft inventory includes primary mission aircraft in each community—those authorized to perform combat—as well as aircraft that are designated for other purposes. The operational portion of the F-22 fleet is organized into 6 operational squadrons at four locations. According to Air Force officials, the small number of F-22s provides a less than ideal fifth generation fighter capacity until F-35 numbers grow. However, in a June 2017 report to Congress, the Air Force stated that it would not make economic or operational sense to reopen the F-22 production line, and reported that it would cost approximately $50 billion to procure an additional 194 F-22s. The Air Force is continuing to fund programs to modernize the F-22 and make reliability improvements. The Air Force has not.",

DSCA’s waiver review process is based on a number of factors. DSCA’s waiver review process is based on a number of factors. DSCA’s waiver review process is based on a number of factors. DSCA’s waiver review process is based on a number of factors. While there is a decades-old requirement to recover the U.S. government’s investment in the nonrecurring costs of major defense equipment it develops and later sells to foreign governments. In some cases, these offices are reviewing waivers to verify similar information, at times leading to repetitive reviews. The same process is applied despite the amount of nonrecurring costs requested to be waived. Generally, this equipment has gone through operational testing and has entered or is entering full-rate production. Multiple federal entities have a role in the FMS program, which included: the country requesting the waiver, the justification under which the waiver was requested, the requested amount of the waiver, whether or not the waiver was approved, the approved value of the waiver, and the military department responsible for managing the procurement of the major defense equipment associated with the requested waiver. We analyzed the data to determine the number and dollar value of waivers requested for each waiver justification in a manner that maximizes efficiency and effectiveness. In light of the significant growth in the FMS program in recent years, as well as the resulting workload for DSCA and other cognizant DOD components, continuing to streamline the waiver review process would better position DSCA and the military departments to review and decide on the waiver request. However, these systems are not integrated and data limitations precluded certain analysis. The FMS program is a central component of U.S. foreign policy. Our work has shown that only eligible countries received a waiver for equipment standardization. All other countries that did not qualify for equipment standardization submitted waiver requests for loss of sale, except for 2 waiver requests that cited cost savings to the U.S. government. As shown in figure 5, all countries that utilized the waiver review process, the percentage of cases represented by the 813 requested waivers. DSCA officials also stated that they have improved their review times by using digital signatures when concurring on waiver decisions. Our prior work has indicated that concerns have been raised about the timeliness of the FMS program, and a DSCA official stated that these efforts were part of a DSCA initiative to increase efficiencies in the overall FMS process. We interviewed DSCA officials to obtain information on how major defense equipment is recorded in DSAMS and the process they use to determine whether a FMS case includes major defense equipment. DSCA officials stated that the review process for waiver requests requires that multiple offices review all waiver requests, regardless of the amount of nonrecurring costs to be waived or the complexity of the specific circumstances. The FMS program has been criticized for being slow and burdensome. To create efficiencies in the overall FMS program, DSCA could take additional steps to streamline the FMS waivers review process. While DSCA has been delegated authority to waive nonrecurring costs, even though military officials stated an assessment has already been conducted to determine how the proposed sale will advance U.S. national security objectives within the region. In addition, DSCA officials stated that since foreign governments are procuring equipment also used by the U.S. military, by default, purchasing the equipment would result in standardization. After a potential sale, DSCA officials stated that waivers are generally used within 5 years, which coincides with the expiration date of the sales agreement. After a potential sale has received a favorable country team assessment, the only additional requirement is to determine whether the customer is NATO or among the 34 countries eligible for the standardization waiver. Yet while this requirement is easily confirmed, the waiver request may still be reviewed by as many as 11 offices within the military department and DSCA, as well as at the OUSD level. However, we found, for example, DSCA did not adjust its review process based on the value of the nonrecurring costs. DSCA provided a dataset that compares approved waivers to costs waived; however, we could not verify equipment quantities from DSAMS. DSCA officials could not confirm whether the 813 waiver requests that they received during fiscal years 2012 through 2017 represented the universe of all sales eligible for waivers under the FMS program, as DSAMS does not consistently track whether an individual FMS case includes major defense equipment and therefore would be eligible for a waiver or subject to the collection of nonrecurring costs. According to DSCA officials, foreign governments rarely forego submitting waiver requests and, invariably, submission of these requests is considered a standard practice. As a result, with few exceptions, DSC",
  ", age, and work experience, may preclude a return to work. More specifically, the manual instructs disability examiners to classify beneficiaries over age 54½ as “medical improvement not expected” because of the remote likelihood that they will be able to engage in medium or heavy work. If RRB routinely compiled and analyzed these data for its own purposes, it could better monitor CDR program performance. This would be consistent with federal internal control standards, which state that management should use program data for effective program monitoring. Routinely compiling and analyzing CDR program data would also allow RRB to identify potential gaps. In fiscal year 2016, RRB received approximately $12 billion in funding, about half of which came from payroll taxes levied on railroad workers and their employers. Almost all of the funding was used to pay benefits, including unemployment benefits. In addition, RRB’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are responsible for determining the amount of funding for RRB’s programs. RRB’s Office of Management and Budget (OPM) is responsible for determining the amount of funding for RRB’s programs. The Office of Management and Budget is responsible for determining the amount of funding for RRB’s programs. In fiscal year 2016, RRB’s regulations state that it will not routinely review the beneficiary’s continuing eligibility. (See fig. 1.) According to RRB’s guidance, factors such as age and work experience may also affect how and when RRB received a report of medical recovery or identified earnings that could affect entitlement to benefits. In its budget submissions for fiscal years 2017-2019, RRB included a legislative proposal seeking access to these quarterly earnings data, since access is limited by statute. RRB maintains a list of scheduled CDRs in its CDR database. RRB has a list of scheduled CDRs in its CDR database. RRB has a list of scheduled CDRs in its CDR database. RRB has a list of scheduled CDRs in its CDR database. In fiscal years 2007-2016, these taxes averaged $5.2 billion annually. Railroad employers and employees pay Tier I taxes, which are the same as taxes levied on Social Security- covered employers and workers. The taxes fund benefits similar to Social Security retirement and disability. Employers and employees also pay Tier II taxes to finance additional railroad retirement benefits. According to RRB data, a worker must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that (1) has lasted (or is expected to last) at least 1 year or is expected to result in death, and (2) prevents them from engaging in substantial gainful activity, defined as work activity that involves significant physical or mental activities performed for pay or profit. In other words, these workers are essentially deemed unable to engage in any regular employment. In fiscal years 2014-2016, RRB has an earnings reconciliation process to determine which beneficiaries may be excluded from an earnings CDR and which should receive one. In fiscal year 2017, RRB considers whether a beneficiary has any disability-related work expenses, such as the cost of special transportation or medication, which are deducted from any earnings, or if the beneficiary has reached full retirement age. (See fig. 2.) In addition, a beneficiary who returns to work or has earnings from employment is required to report that information to RRB, and the agency may initiate a CDR depending on the circumstances. If a potential overpayment is identified as a result of a CDR, the Disability Benefits Division refers the case to another division within RRB to calculate the overpayment amount. Over the 3 years for which RRB was able to provide information, the agency may identify additional overpayments. RRB’s records show that RRB’s records show that RRB may identify additional overpayments but RRB is slow to calculate overpayments. We determined that the overpayment data RRB provided for CDRs completed during 2014-2016 were incomplete. For example, a case file review of six randomly selected earnings CDRs completed in fiscal year 2016 found that in three of the cases, the office responsible for calculating overpayments, had not calculated the overpayments identified by those 2016 reviews. Our findings and PEMS’s 2016 conclusions indicate that these high-risk medical CDRs have not been effective, the agency expends resources on these reviews that could be used for other purposes that are more effective in identifying ineligible beneficiaries. RRB’s lack of routine data collection and analysis hampers its ability to monitor program performance and determine what changes, if any, should be made to improve the CDR program, including determining the number of beneficiaries in each medical improvement category and the costs and benefits of conducting the various types of reviews. While continuing to conduct high-risk CDRs, RRB may be expending resources that could be used for other purposes that are more effective in identifying ineligible beneficiaries. RRB could be",

The Coast Guard will continue to monitor these actions. Use more realistic asset performance data. In our May 2016 report on Coast Guard strategic planning, we found that the Coast Guard did not provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets, by mission. We reported that the Coast Guard did not provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets, by mission. We reported that the Coast Guard’s strategic allocations of assets were based on unrealistic assumptions about the performance capacity of its assets and did not reflect asset condition and unscheduled maintenance. This was due, in part, to the Coast Guard not including information from its field units on the actual performance of its assets. For example, agency officials noted that one of its classes of cutters was 50 years old and these cutters were hampered by mechanical failures requiring emergency dry dock repairs, which resulted in reduced availability to carry out their missions during the year. In another example, a field unit stated that based on historical use, it planned for 575 hours per vessel for one type of cutter instead of the 825 hours performance capacity. Because actual asset use has consistently fallen below asset performance capacities, there is not a direct alignment between the Coast Guard’s strategic operational goals and its prospects for achieving those goals. As a result, the Coast Guard’s strategic intent, which is based on asset capacity rather than actual performance, did not provide the field with strategic, realistic goals for allocating assets by mission. Agencies should use quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and timely to achieve objectives and address related risks. We recommended that the Coast Guard take several actions to gain an understanding of what the Coast Guard needs to meet its mission within its likely acquisition funding levels. These recommended actions included the Coast Guard’s assets used to conduct a comprehensive portfolio review of its assets, including a comprehensive portfolio of assets, including a comprehensive portfolio of assets, including a comprehensive portfolio of assets, including a comprehensive portfolio of assets, including a comprehensive portfolio of assets, including a comprehensive portfolio of assets, including a comprehensive portfolio of assets, including a comprehensive portfolio of assets. The Coast Guard’s assets used to conduct these missions are approaching the end of their intended service lives. As part of its efforts to modernize its assets used to carry out various missions, the Coast Guard has begun acquiring new vessels, such as the National Security Cutter, the Fast Response Cutter as well as other assets. However, concerns surrounding the affordability of this effort remain as the Coast Guard continues to pursue multiple new acquisitions without long-term planning to guide the affordability of its acquisition portfolio. Figure 1 shows the Coast Guard’s five year average number of recreational boating deaths and injuries. In particular, officials believe that many recreational boating injuries that do not require hospitalization are not reported to the Coast Guard. These officials believe that the amount of underreporting may vary over time due to changes in industry trends, making it difficult to accurately determine actual injury rates and program performance. We determined that the data for this performance goal was not sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives due to these likely limitations. We found that the Coast Guard did not report the possible extent of these limitations with this performance goal in its fiscal year 2016 APR. For the other performance goal, the Coast Guard did not report the possible extent of these limitations with this performance goal in its fiscal year 2016 APR. For the other performance goal, the Coast Guard and DHS identified limitations with the number of detected incursions of foreign fishing vessels violating U.S. waters, which is publicly reported in DHS’s APR. The Coast Guard has stated it is developing a 20-year Long-term Major Acquisition Plan, but it has not stated when the plan will be completed or what will be included in this plan, such as potential trade-offs that could be made across the Coast Guard’s performance. Specifically, the review noted that this performance goal is intended to measure a deterrence effect, but doing so is inherently difficult and may lead to contradictory interpretations of performance. In October 2017, we found that the data for this performance goal was sufficiently reliable for our reporting objective purposes, but questions remain about its validity. Reliable data is not a useful indication of performance unless it is also a valid representation of the goal being addressed. DHS officials reported that they did not include a discussion of the limitations for this performance goal in DHS’s fiscal year 2015 APR because the performance goal met the minimum threshold for data reliability despite the goal’s limitations. Coast Guard officials reported they were aware of these limitations and were working with DHS and OMB to improve the performance goal and implement corrective actions within 1 to 2 years. We recommended that the Coast Guard assess the extent to which documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations and update these documents, as needed, based on the results of the assessment.",

NRC could not ensure that it was evaluating contractor charges consistently and appropriately before billing those charges to licensees. In 2015, NRC provided training to staff who manage contracts, which, according to NRC officials, resulted in an immediate decrease in associated billing errors. NRC also revised its guidance to clarify responsibilities, procedures, and instructions for reviewing and approving contractor invoices. NRC’s OIG and internal reviews identified conditions that made the quarterly validation step in the billing process challenging for staff to perform and that led to inconsistent validation procedures among program and regional offices. NRC has taken or plans to take the following two actions to address these problems: Improving validation reports. According to NRC documents, the quarterly validation reports contained billing data for all program and regional offices—sometimes amounting to more than 4,000 pages of data—and the reports did not have the sorting functionality or querying capability that would allow NRC staff to extract relevant information. NRC staff in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the agency has not formally notified all licensees about the availability of this supplemental information because it is time-consuming to provide it to licensees. NRC’s billing process. NRC’s billing process for service fees begins by identifying work that can be billed to a specific licensee and ends when the licensee pays the quarterly invoice. Once NRC determines that billable work needs to be done, the agency follows the steps in the billing process shown in figure 1. The steps in NRC’s billing process are described in more detail below. NRC assigns activity code: After billable work is identified, NRC assigns an activity code, which is a project code to which NRC employees charge time for billable work performed. The project plan integrates and consolidates plans for project components, such as plans for managing the project’s scope, schedule, cost, quality, and risk, among others. The management of activity codes was decentralized, meaning that staff in NRC’s offices generated the codes and each office followed its own policies and procedures regarding the setup and use of these codes. NRC also did not have a standardized set of activity codes to be used across the agency. Activity codes were instead",

  ", in addition to the general management and oversight challenges we cited in adding VA to our High-Risk List in 2015. Specifically, we reported in our 2017 update to the High-Risk List that VA faces challenges regarding the reliability, transparency, and consistency of its budget estimates for medical services, as well as weaknesses in tracking obligations for medical services and estimating budgetary needs for future years. These challenges were evident in June 2015, when VA requested authority from Congress to move funds from IHS’s medical services to its tribal health care facilities. In addition, in June 2015, the agency requested authority from Congress to move funds from IHS’s medical services to its tribal health care facilities. In June 2015, the agency requested authority from Congress to move funds from another appropriation account because agency officials projected a fiscal year 2015 funding gap of about $3 billion in its medical services appropriation account. IHS officials said that many providers in rural and remote locations are the sole source of income for their families, and the potential for delays in pay resulting from government shutdowns can serve as a disincentive for employees considering public service in critical shortage areas that do not offer adequate spousal employment opportunities. Tribal representatives said CRs create challenges for tribes in funding planned pay increases—such as cost-of-living adjustments— for health care staff at their facilities, and they may, as a result, defer increases. IHS officials said that, in general, most health care services would be expected to continue at IHS-operated facilities during a shutdown, as health care providers would be deemed “excepted” personnel under the agency’s contingency plan. The IHS area offices are responsible for distributing funds to the facilities in their areas, monitoring their operation, and providing guidance and technical assistance. One tribal representative stated that advance appropriations could help with recruitment by providing perceived job stability that is similar to VA or the private sector. According to VA VISN officials, the agency’s experience with advance appropriation authority suggests that advance appropriations can be used to reduce the amount of funding that is required to provide health care services for tribal health care programs, similar to the authority that VA currently has for its health care appropriation accounts. HHS, on behalf of IHS, has not requested that IHS be granted advance appropriation authority during its annual budget submissions to Congress. For example, in 2017, the agency transferred approximately 54 percent of its total budget authority to tribes and tribal organizations to operate part or all of their own health care programs through self-determination contracts and self- governance compacts. IHS officials and tribal representatives said budget uncertainty can lead to vendor reluctance to provide services to IHS and tribally operated facilities. IHS officials also said that while lapses in appropriations do not halt patient care, they do create complications—such as the determination of excepted personnel as described above—that could be eliminated by funding provided through advance appropriations. Tribal representatives said the certainty of funding that would come with IHS’s annual appropriations for health care include advance appropriations that become available in the fiscal year after the fiscal year for which the appropriations act was enacted. In our 2009 testimony, we noted that proposals to change the availability of the appropriations for VA deserved careful scrutiny, given the challenges the agency faces in formulating its health care budget and the changing nature of health care. Similar consideration would apply to IHS. According to VISN officials, vendors can be hard to find in remote and rural areas, and their perception of funding certainty can play a role in encouraging their participation as government contractors. As contracting with the federal government can be burdensome, particularly for smaller vendors, VISN officials said, any measures—such as advance appropriations—that could enhance the stability of agency contracting could make these vendors more likely to participate in government contracting. Administrative burden and costs. IHS officials and tribal representatives said the agency and tribes incur additional administrative burden and costs when the government is funded through the advance appropriation—the full amount, or less (as is the case for VA)? Which appropriations accounts would be included? Further, would funds intended for transfer to tribes be handled differently? (2) Under what conditions, if any, would there be changes to funding provided through advance appropriations during the next budget cycle? For example, would Congress expect to adjust the advance appropriation amount through a “second bite,” as is the case with VA? Congressional flexibility considerations. We reported in 2009 that consideration of any proposal to change the availability of the appropriations VA receives for health care should take into account the impact of any change on congressional flexibility and oversight. As part of this process, IHS officials said that advance appropriations would allow tribes to plan for long-term health initiatives. The official’s specific tribe has a gestational diabetes program in conjunction with a local university that the tribe could plan to take full responsibility for if they had more funding stability. In the subsequent year (the year during which the advance appropriation can be used), VA may request an adjustment to the amount previously provided through advance appropriations—re",

As of May 2017, OMB and agencies have completed a comprehensive review of their IT systems and operations. As we have previously noted, in order to take the preceding actions and strengthen the federal government’s cybersecurity posture, agencies should implement the information security programs required by FISMA. In this regard, we identified 31,493 additional contracts with $4.5 billion obligated, raising the total amount obligated by these agencies to IT contracts, as of August 2017. In many instances, agencies had not consistently applied best practices that are critical to successfully acquiring IT. Such projects have also failed due to a lack of oversight and governance. Executive-level governance and oversight across the government has often been ineffective, specifically from CIOs. For example, agencies are to conduct a self-assessment and submit a plan describing the changes they intend to make to ensure that common baseline responsibilities are implemented. In our 2015 high-risk report’s discussion of IT acquisitions and operations, we identified the management of IT systems as an area of concern, in part because of the potential for cost savings. Specifically, our preliminary results show that at least 10 of the CIOs indicated that they were less than very effective for each of the six areas of responsibility. We believe that until agencies fully address the role of CIOs in their policies, agencies will be limited in addressing longstanding IT management challenges. This strategy is to include, among other things, a statement from the agency CIO indicating whether the agency has complied with all data center reporting requirements in FITARA. Further, we reported that OMB is to maintain a public dashboard to display consolidation-related costs savings and optimization performance information for the agencies. In addition, we reported that, since the 2015 data breaches, the agencies have taken legislative action to extend selected provisions beyond their original dates of expiration. In order to determine the effectiveness of the agencies’ information security programs and practices, FISMA requires that federal agencies had taken actions to prevent, mitigate, and respond to data breaches involving sensitive personal and background investigation information. However, we noted that the agencies had not fully implemented recommendations made to OMB by DHS’s United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team to help the agency improve its overall security posture and improve its ability to protect its systems and information from security breaches. In July 2017, we found that only 2 of the 24 selected agencies had established comprehensive software license inventories, a leading practice that would help them to adequately manage their software licenses. An underlying reason for these weaknesses was that the Internal Revenue Service had not effectively implemented elements of its information security program. In May 2016, we reported that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, OPM, and the Department of Veteran Affairs did not always control access to selected high-impact systems, which is why they did not have access to known software vulnerabilities, and plan for contingencies. An underlying reason for these weaknesses was that the agencies had not fully implemented key elements of their information security programs.

  "’s request that sponsors provide additional safety and effectiveness data for sunscreen applications. ’s request that sponsors provide additional safety and effectiveness data to determine if an active ingredient is GRASE for use in sunscreens. The mechanism has not been employed to date, because, as of August 2017, FDA had met its required time frames for reviewing and initially responding to sunscreen applications. Figure 1 illustrates the post-SIA process for FDA’s review of sunscreen applications that had been pending for many years. Without the act, some of them questioned whether FDA would have reviewed the sunscreen applications or provided feedback to the sponsors. As of October 2017, FDA officials said that the agency has not received any of the additional safety and effectiveness data requested for the eight sunscreen active ingredients seeking a GRASE determination. According to sponsor representatives we spoke with, the sponsors are either still considering whether to conduct the additional tests FDA requested or they do not plan to do so. The reasons cited by the sponsor representatives and stakeholders included the following: Safety and effectiveness data for sunscreen applications. FDA’s request for additional safety and effectiveness data for sunscreen applications. FDA’s request for additional safety and effectiveness data is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data. Some of the stakeholders said the profit margins for these types of products can be low, and other stakeholders and sponsors said that once an active ingredient is determined to be GRASE and added to the OTC monograph, then anyone can market products using that active ingredient, as there is no period of market exclusivity granted to sponsors. Additionally, some stakeholders and sponsors added that the sponsors are reluctant to spend money on additional testing, because of concerns about safety and effectiveness. FDA’s request for additional safety and effectiveness data for sunscreen applications, which affects whether FDA will recommend additional testing, were unreasonably low or unrealistic. FDA officials stated that a MUsT is a fairly recent term for a pharmacokinetic test under maximum use, which is a test that has been used for dermal products since the 1990s. They added that when alternative testing methods were proposed to FDA in place of the MUsT and other tests recommended by the agency, FDA rejected the alternatives. Further, when a sponsor asked the agency if the ingredient’s safety and effectiveness would be evaluated, FDA rejected the application. FDA’s request for additional safety and effectiveness data for sunscreen applications. FDA’s request for additional safety and effectiveness data is unreasonably low or unrealistic. FDA’s request for additional safety and effectiveness data is unreasonably low or unrealistic. FDA’s request for additional safety and effectiveness data FDA requested are equal to or more rigorous than what are submitted for an NDA. In particular, a stakeholder noted that FDA requested additional safety and effectiveness testing for an application to market the ingredient under the OTC monograph process from a company that already had an approved NDA for a product containing the same active ingredient (ecamsule). FDA officials indicated that active ingredients under consideration for inclusion in an OTC monograph may require some studies to demonstrate that the ingredient is GRASE for OTC use that would not be required for approval of an individual drug product through an NDA. Specifically, FDA officials said such studies may be needed because once an ingredient is found to be GRASE it can be formulated in many ways (in accordance with the monograph) and marketed in multiple sunscreen products without further agency review. Additionally, FDA issued a final rule in November 2016 outlining the process and time frames by which the agency will review and take action on new non-sunscreen TEAs submitted after the enactment of SIA, including time frames for each step in the review process. According to one stakeholder, there is concern that sponsors may spend additional time and money on conducting the tests requested by FDA and the sunscreen active ingredient may still not be determined to be GRASE. In addition to requiring FDA to issue two additional reports to Congress in 2018 and 2020, SIA requires FDA to finalize the sunscreen monograph by November 26, 2019. See table 2 for the status of FDA’s implementation of SIA requirements and corresponding time frames. FDA also implemented changes to the process for reviewing sunscreen applications as required by SIA. Some stakeholders noted that sunscreen active ingredients that are currently marketed are not subject to this level of scrutiny. According to FDA officials, given the increased usage of sunscreen, coupled with increased knowledge of how drugs are absorbed into the skin, the agency has changed its perspective on what it needs to determine if sunscreen active ingredients are GRASE. FDA officials said that when the OTC monographs first started in the 1970s, it was thought that topical products would remain on the skin rather than be absorbed, but science has shown that some topical drugs, including some active ingredients used in sunscreens, are absorbed through the skin. Because of this knowledge, FDA officials said that the agency now considers potential dermal absorption for every topically applied drug. Lack of access to some requested",

FCC has provided information on FCC’s strategic goal of increasing broadband access and to develop maps and reports intended to depict broadband access on tribal lands. FCC does not have a formal process for tribes (or other governmental entities) to provide input to ensure that the broadband data FCC collects through the 477 process, or the resulting maps that FCC creates to depict broadband on tribal lands, are accurate. In 2011, FCC launched a series of reforms to its data collection process, including adding support for broadband services, and created the Connect America Fund, which provides subsidies to provide information about broadband services. FCC and tribal stakeholders working to target broadband services, and FCC would be better able to ensure the accuracy of its broadband data. The providers must file an annual report documenting that this engagement included a discussion of, among other things, a needs assessment and deployment planning for communications services, including broadband. FCC’s 2012 guidance on fulfilling the engagement obligations, which FCC officials confirmed is still in effect, noted that the stated goal of the engagement requirement was to benefit tribal government leaders, providers, and consumers by fostering a dialogue between tribal governments and providers that would lead to improved services. Additionally, in its 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on modernizing the Form 477 data collection, FCC acknowledged that by requiring a provider to report where it could provide service, it is impossible to tell whether the provider would be unable or unwilling to provide advanced capabilities and thus whether users can access high-quality telecommunications. Additionally, almost all of the tribal stakeholders we spoke to raised concerns that FCC’s broadband deployment data rely solely on unverified information submitted by providers. Additionally, FCC has acknowledged that FCC’s mobile broadband data, and FCC has acknowledged concerns that the lack of a standardized method resulted in data that were unreliable for the purposes of determining broadband coverage for specific geographic areas, such as tribal lands. FCC has also recognized that by measuring availability at the census block level, not every person will have access to broadband in a block that the data show as served, and FCC has noted that in rural areas, such as tribal lands, census blocks can be large and providers may only deploy service to a portion of the census block. A few representatives for tribal governments and organizations noted that the use of census blocks may uniquely overstate broadband availability on tribal lands when census blocks contain both tribal and non-trib",

DOD’s procurement process includes a number of factors, such as the amount of time to award contracts. DOD’s procurement process includes a number of factors, such as the amount of time to award contracts. DOD’s efforts are in the early stages, they have not established which specific events to measure and how they will use the information collected. We discussed contract award time frames included in studies or analysis to determine the selected components’ or commands’ reasons for conducting the analysis, any challenges identified, actions taken to address those challenges, and ongoing efforts to reduce the time needed to complete the contract award process. Our review of a nongeneralizable selection of 129 weapon systems- related contracts had a wide range of time intervals from solicitation issuance to award. The time intervals from solicitation to award ranged from less than a month to more than 4 years, with a median of about 9 months. Based on our analysis, 88 of the 129 contracts were awarded less than a year from the solicitation issuance date, with the negotiations phase taking about 8 months from approval to enter into negotiations to approval for contract award. The remaining 3 selected contracts took more than 2 years to award. We analyzed the time taken to award contracts based on three characteristics identified by some DOD officials and contractor representatives that may affect the time taken to award contracts: contract value, extent competed, and contract type. We did not observe any patterns based on these characteristics. We found the time to award contracts by phases, from solicitation issuance to contract award. These phases are based on discrete events found in the procurement process, such as the amount of time to award contracts, and the factors used to evaluate proposals and their relative importance. Those who wish to respond must submit their proposal to the government office in the time and manner stated in the request for proposals. We consider the solicitation phase to begin with solicitation issuance and end at the deadline to submit the initial proposals. Initial Evaluation: Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the proposals and the offerors’ ability to perform the competitively awarded contracts. During that period, labor rates had changed, which increased the time needed to submit a proposal so that these changes could be incorporated. According to Air Force officials, they establish fiscal year goals to measure progress based on the average of schedule dates. The data for both the sole-source contracts and now the competitive contracts are collected through a manual data call and are entered into a spreadsheet. The data are reported to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition. In November 2017, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) called for the formation of an Army-wide team to examine approaches for improving procurement time frames similar to one already underway at the Army Contracting Command. The data base collects information starting from pre-solicitation efforts, which includes the purchase request to contract award. The system includes interim dates within the contract award process, such as the beginning of evaluation. Contracting officials are responsible for capturing both planned and actual dates in the system. Analysis of the variation between the planned and actual dates can be used to identify areas where difficulties occur. Contracting officials with contracts awarded using other than full and open competition cited contractor responsiveness to requests for additional information as a factor regardless of the time needed to complete both types of evaluations. For cost or price evaluations, contracting officials cited factors related to the proposal, such as its quality and timeliness, as among the factors that helped shorten the time. In a case study involving a Navy sole-source research and development contract valued over $1 billion for the Next Generation Jammer, contracting and program officials said it took the contractor about 4 months after submitting the initial proposal to provide the contracting office a complete proposal due to delays in getting subcontractor information. DOD officials also plan to expand this effort to include competitively awarded contracts. While DOD officials",
  " for them to consistently do so. Data on termination codes may therefore not be consistently reported by issuers. CMS officials told us that, starting in June 2017, it would allow issuers, subject to state law, to apply a new premium payment to an individual’s past due payments before applying that premium towards a new enrollment. Officials stated that key essential variables that CMS does track are whether coverage is effectuated (that is, whether the first premium payment has been made), whether the enrollee is eligible for APTC payments, and whether coverage was terminated. In addition, when issuers do report termination reason codes, these data are not always accurate. Specifically, CMS told us that, historically, issuers may have incorrectly used the nonpayment termination code for other types of terminations, and two issuers we interviewed acknowledged having done so. We compared data on terminations for nonpayment from CMS’s centralized enrollment system with data we obtained from three issuers for a small selection of enrollees. We found that for one large issuer operating in multiple states, issuers may have incorrectly used the nonpayment termination code for other types of terminations, and two issuers we interviewed acknowledged having done so. We compared data on terminations for nonpayment from CMS’s centralized enrollment system with data we obtained from three issuers for a small selection of enrollees. We found that for one large issuer operating in multiple states, the CMS data indicated that coverage for 18 of the 26 enrollees that we examined had been terminated for nonpayment of premiums, while the issuer data indicated that coverage had been terminated for nonpayment of premiums, while the issuer data indicated that coverage had been terminated for other reasons, in most cases because it had expired at the end of the year. The issuer indicated that it likely reported these year-end terminations to CMS incorrectly as terminations for nonpayment of premiums. CMS concurred with our first recommendation to require issuers to report data on terminations for nonpayment, but these actions do not ensure the data are consistently reported and recorded by CMS. Additionally, CMS noted that it currently collects information on termination reasons on enrollment transactions with issuers, and that it would review the requirements for collection of these data to identify possible improvements. HHS also concurred with our second recommendation to ensure a transparent process for issuers to use to help prevent inaccurate reporting of the nonpayment termination code. CMS told us that it expects issuers to begin using the new codes in 2018. CMS’s data on terminations for nonpayment therefore may be more reliable beginning in 2018. However, CMS has not required issuers to report the termination reasons in the transaction files because, according to CMS officials, these data are not essential to tracking the accuracy of APTC payments. The agency also does not have plans in the near future to use the data in tracking trends in enrollment and termination of enrollee coverage in the FFE to assess the overall stability of the exchange. Further, CMS does not have a transparent, systematic process for issuers to ensure that data on terminations for nonpayment are complete and accurate. Through this process, APTC amounts and their effective dates are compared and reconciled. CMS’s data system is considered to be correct when considering discrepancies on overall enrollment counts or with key data elements, such as coverage start and end dates between issuer and CMS data. Therefore, CMS will not change the APTC payments based on issuers’ data that may differ from CMS’s data unless there are significant discrepancies. There are several specific steps involved in transferring data between CMS and issuers for initial enrollment, subsequent updates, and reconciliation (see fig. 3). However, more individuals who enrolled through an SEP remained enrolled through December 31, 2015, compared to individuals who enrolled during open enrollment—72 percent compared to 64 percent. Age. Enrollees aged 55 or older had the highest average length of coverage, while those aged 25 to 34 had the lowest—9.2 months compared to 7.8 months. Reported household income. APTC-eligible enrollees who reported having a household income between 301 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level had the highest average length of coverage, while those who reported having a household income less than, or equal to, 100 percent of the federal poverty level had the lowest—8.9 months compared to 8.0 months. Eligibility for APTC. Enrollees may be allowing enrollees who lost exchange coverage for nonpayment of premiums to re-enroll under SEPs although, under federal regulations, these individuals are ineligible to do so. Issuers reported that this had occurred. CMS officials told us that the agency is exploring options to have its system automatically prevent certain enrollees with prior terminations for nonpayment from enrolling in coverage under an SEP for loss of existing coverage, but noted that this functionality would depend on enrollees enrolling in coverage under an SEP for loss of existing coverage, but noted that this functionality would depend on enrollment—72 percent compared to 64 percent",

We determined that the volumes of U.S. inbound and outbound international mail using the following alternatives: bilateral and multilateral agreements, and (3) parcels increased, while Express Mail Service volume decreased. U.S. consumers may also benefit from all four alternatives due to faster delivery than under the terminal dues system and from special features such as tracking, especially for higher-value items. According to USPS officials, packets sent under the terminal dues system do not include any tracking and have a delivery time of up to 3 weeks from some countries, while all USPS domestic mail products include tracking and have delivery times from as short as one day to an average of 2 to 3 days. U.S. businesses and consumers benefit from this disparity as the postage they pay USPS to send mail to those countries is based on the terminal dues rates (or if not consistent, provide a foreign policy or national security interest justification).

To date, PFOS and PFOA are unregulated because EPA has not made a positive regulatory determination for these chemicals. Even when EPA has not issued a regulation, EPA may publish drinking water health advisories. In contrast to drinking water regulations, health advisories are nonenforceable. Health advisories recommend the amount of contaminants that can be present in drinking water—“health advisory levels”—at which adverse health effects are not anticipated to occur over specific exposure durations. In response to the order from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the Air Force closed drinking water wells, installed new monitoring wells, and provided bottled water to vulnerable populations on the installation. Additional details on each order and examples of actions by DOD to address the orders were reported on in our October 2017 report. According to DOD, it may take several years for the department to determine how much it will cost to clean up PFOS and PFOA contamination at or near its military installations. According to DOD, the department also considers information in these health advisories when determining the need for cleanup action at installations with PFOS and PFOA contamination. We reported in October 2017 that, following the release of EPA’s lifetime health advisory for PFOS and PFOA in May 2016, each of the military departments directed their installations to identify locations with any known or suspected prior release of PFOS and PFOA and to address any releases that pose a risk to human health—which can include people living outside DOD installations; and test for PFOS and PFOA in their drinking water and address any contamination above EPA’s lifetime health advisory level. We further reported that, as of December 2016, DOD had identified 393 active or closed military installations with any known or suspected releases of PFOS or PFOA. Since we issued our report, DOD has updated that number to 401 active or closed installations, according to August 2017 data provided in a March 2018 report to Congress on the department’s response to PFOS and PFOA contamination. We stated in our October 2017 report that the military departments had reported spending approximately $200 million at or near 263 installations for environmental investigations and response actions, such as installing treatment systems or supplying bottled water, as of December 2016. The Air Force had identified 203 installations with known or suspected releases of PFOS and PFOA and had spent about $153 million on environmental investigations and response actions (accounting for about 77 percent of what the military departments had spent on PFOS and PFOA activities as of December 2016). For example, the Air Force reported spending over $5 million at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. During our visit to that installation in November 2016, officials showed us the current military installations with no PFOS and PFOA.",
  ", and bank loan underwriting standards, and bank loan underwriting standards. The purpose of federal banking supervision is to help ensure that banks throughout the financial system are operating in a safe and sound manner and are complying with banking laws and regulations in the provision of financial services. Specifically, we reviewed and analyzed commercial property vacancy data from REIS (a private commercial real estate data provider); commercial property construction data from the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), first quarter 1991 to second quarter 2017. (See below for an illustrative regression equation for one of these models.) According to the guidance, the exercise of examiner judgment to determine the scope and depth of review in each functional area is crucial to the success of the risk-focused supervisory process. In 2011, we reported on how the federal banking regulators had responded to the potential risks of growing CRE concentrations at community banks, including by jointly issuing the 2006 CRE concentration guidance. We recommended that the regulators should enhance or supplement the 2006 CRE concentration guidance. We recommended that the regulators should enhance or supplement the 2006 CRE guidance and take steps to better ensure that such guidance is consistently applied. The regulators have taken steps to address our recommendation. Out of the approximately 5,900 banks that had a CRE loan portfolio as of the end of June 2017, a total of 504 banks exceeded either 100 percent in CLD loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital, or 300 percent in CRE loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital and had seen 50 percent CRE portfolio growth during the previous 36 months. As part of a full-scope examination, examiners review a bank’s risk exposure within a number of components using the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, which also is referred to as the CAMELS rating system (capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk). Evaluations of CAMELS components consider a bank’s CLD and CRE concentrations as well as its CLD and CRE concentrations as well as its CLD and CRE concentrations. The bulk of the explanatory power of the model appears to come from the interaction of the level of CRE concentrations, though it remains lower than the level of risk associated with the 2007– 2009 financial crisis. In contrast, in 2 reports of examination, we found that FDIC examiners did not find the banks’ CRE concentrations to be adequate for their CRE concentration risk. In other reports of examination, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC did not identify the banks’ CRE concentrations to be adequate for their CRE concentration risk. In other reports of examination, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC did not identify the banks’ CRE concentrations to be adequate for their CRE concentration risk. In other reports of examination, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC, their agencies use a variety of formal and informal processes to monitor the condition of banks and identify risks, including CRE concentration risk. In addition to using banks’ CRE concentrations as a basis to select examinations, we judgmentally selected a nonprobability sample of banks based on the following criteria: Total asset size: We considered the size of the banks based on their CRE concentrations. We considered the size of the banks based on their CRE concentrations in 2015 and brought the issue to the National Risk Committee’s attention. In our review of a nongeneralizable sample of 54 examinations conducted from 2013 through 2016, we found that FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC subjected banks with relatively high concentrations in CRE concentrations to greater supervisory scrutiny. In both their 2006 CRE guidance and 2015 CRE statement, the regulators indicated that banks with relatively high CLD or CRE concentrations, 26 of them covered two examination cycles of 13 banks during this period. OCC took 11 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters related to their CRE concentrations during this same period. The majority of these formal enforcement actions discussed the 2006 CRE guidance and directed the banks to improve their practices for managing their concentration risk. In all of these examinations, we found that the banks had adequate risk management practices in both examinations. In six examinations (covering three banks), examiners found aspects of the banks’ risk management practices to be inadequate in their 2013 or 2014 examination and noted their supervisory concerns in the reports of examination. In the subsequent examinations, the examiners found that the banks had adequately addressed the CRE concentrations. We also interviewed officials from FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC, and from a national banking association about bank CRE lending and applicable CRE guidance and requirements. For the data we analyzed under both of our objectives, we took a number of steps to assess the reliability of the data, including interviewing data providers; corroborating trends across multiple data sources; reviewing related documentation; inspecting data for missing values, outliers, or other errors; and reviewing relevant, prior GAO work. In addition, by the time the construction phase is completed, 41 of them covered banks that did not exceed the CLD or CRE thresholds. Although the banks did not exceed either threshold, OCC examiners assessed the banks",

In addition, FCC and RUS funding totaled $34.6 billion during that time period and tribes and tribally owned providers received $235 million, or about 0.7 percent. When we asked RUS officials about the feasibility of doing so, they said that they have limited resources and multiple competing priorities for those resources.

In 2010, the District received a broadband service created new technical jobs with professional growth opportunities on the reservation. When meeting with tribal leaders and officials, we used the same semi-structured interview questions for all tribes; however, tribal officials may not have answered all questions. Because we limited our review to these seven selected partnership examples, our findings are not generalizable. To determine the amount of funding from key federal programs provided to tribal entities, even though the National Broadband Plan stressed that tribes needed substantially greater financial support and recommended that federal agencies facilitate tribal access to broadband deployment. The two primary barriers these interviewees cited were (1) the statutory requirement for ETC designation and (2) grant application requirements. However, a tribal official told us that the tribal government may provide broadband access to their communities. However, RUS has not taken steps to identify or address the barriers tribes face when applying for RUS grant funding. In 2010, FCC officials provided $300 million in 2012 in one-time support to providers to expand broadband service in areas where service was not available, including tribal lands. The Tribal officials in 2010, Pine received a BTOP grant of $9.5 million to deploy broadband infrastructure to underserved areas of Southeastern Oklahoma, including Choctaw Nation lands. According to tribal officials and representatives from Pine, the partnership enabled tribal government agencies and buildings— including public schools, public safety agencies, fire and police departments, and a health clinic—to get broadband service. In 2010, NTUA received a BTOP grant of $32 million to deploy broadband infrastructure covering 15,000 square miles across the three states. According to the project’s progress report submitted to NTIA, by 2013, NTUA leveraged BTOP funding to deploy broadband service to meet immediate economic, education, health service, and public safety needs of the tribe. However, based on our meetings with both KCEC representatives and Taos Pueblo officials they have different perspectives about the success of this partnership at delivering broadband service to the tribe. We took steps to assess the reliability of the data—such as cross-checking the data, following up with agency officials, and reviewing documentation—and found the data were not",

VHA’s opioid risk mitigation strategies have been implemented. VHA has also developed opioid risk mitigation strategies for its providers to follow when prescribing opioids to determine if the veteran has obtained opioid medications or other controlled substances. These key strategies include one whose increased use is an explicit goal for the OSI and two that are requirements in VHA policy. According to VHA, an education course for providers on naloxone prescribing became available in December 2015, and naloxone education efforts are a key focus of academic detailing programs. VHA officials told us that they addressed this goal by issuing national tapering guidance, including a provider reference guide in 2014, an opioid taper decision tool in 2016, and the VA/DOD clinical practice guidelines in 2017. However, these actions do not appear to be sufficient for meeting the goal as it is currently written, because issuing national guidance alone does not ensure that safe and effective tapering programs are established. According to the nurses, such an alert could be issued through the electronic medical record system. VHA has begun tracking and publicly reporting data on four key metrics related to opioid prescriptions, and these data show that opioid prescription rates have decreased since 2013.

VHA’s ability to ensure that each VISN has a fully staffed academic detailing program and that each facility has a designated primary care pain champion, as VHA policy requires. In addition, VHA data, the facilities provided feedback and follow-up actions for VHA’s opioid risk mitigation strategies. The guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations designed to help ensure providers’ adhere to the opioid risk mitigation strategies. These efforts include regular reviews of veterans’ medical records and creating electronic alerts reminding providers when these risk mitigation strategies have not been completed. According to one VHA Central Office official, as of September 2017, VHA was reviewing these outlier data and will evaluate whether VHA facilities will be asked to conduct further reviews of these prescribers. In addition, in some states, VHA has not established this requirement or outlined the process for monitoring providers’ use of opioids. VHA has also implemented a system- wide academic detailing program to educate providers and improve the delivery of evidence-based health care at facilities. According to a VHA official, the VHA facility in Manila, the Philippines did not offer at least one psychosocial service and at least one integrative health service for this time period. According to VHA officials, academic detailers are responsible for reviewing facility-level data on the prescribing patterns of providers and identifying potential areas of improvement. According to the clinical practice guidelines, naloxone should be offered as an antidote to all patients at risk for an opioid overdose, including those who are in the process of tapering from opioids. The guidelines describe several significant risk factors which can indicate the prescribing of naloxone, including the duration and dose of opioids, current or history of depression or substance use disorder, and suicidality. 3. Appropriate follow-up visits with a provider. According to VHA officials, VHA’s medical record currently has real- time alerts to inform providers about veterans’ existing opioid prescriptions and that any patient exposed to an opioid could be at risk of developing an opioid use disorder.

  "SPV-NG program office and VA’s procurement process. Without clear guidance, many medical centers reported they were unable to find direct matches or substitutes on the MSPV-NG formulary for a substantial number of items they routinely used, which negatively impacted utilization rates for the initial formulary. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the Director of the MSPV- NG program office provide complete guidance to medical centers for matching equivalent supply items. VA agreed with this recommendation and indicated it would provide this guidance to medical centers. Further, the SAC division director told us that they canceled all outstanding Phase 2 solicitations in September 2017 due to low response rates, protests from service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and changes in overall MSPV-NG strategy. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the MSPV-NG program office and SAC should establish a plan for how to mitigate the potential risk of gaps in contract coverage while SAC is still working to make competitive Phase 2 awards, which could include prioritizing supply categories that are most likely to yield cost avoidance. VA agreed with this recommendation and indicated it has developed a plan to mitigate the risk of gaps in contract coverage with short- and mid-term procurement strategies to ensure continued provision of medical and surgical supplies to VHA facilities. VA agreed with this recommendation. VA agreed with this recommendation and indicated it has developed a plan to mitigate the risk of gaps in contract coverage with short- and mid-term procurement strategies to ensure continued provision of medical and surgical supplies to VHA facilities. The department also stated that it plans to replace the current MSPV-NG program office directors and a new set of prime vendor contracts to distribute the supplies. VA’s goals for the MSPV-NG program include (1) standardizing requirements for supply items for greater clinical consistency; (2) demonstrating cost avoidance by leveraging VA’s substantial buying power when making competitive awards; (3) achieving greater efficiency in ordering and supply chain management, including a metric of ordering 40 percent of medical centers’ supplies from the MSPV-NG formulary; and (4) involving clinicians in requirements development to ensure uniform clinical review of medical supplies. VHA launched the MSPV-NG program in December 2016, but allowed a 4-month transition period. After April 2017, medical centers could no longer use the legacy program. VHA’s strategy for the MSPV-NG program was based on the need for clinical review of medical supplies. VHA’s strategy for the MSPV-NG program was based on the need for clinical review of medical supplies. VHA’s strategy for the MSPV-NG is essential to VA achieving the cost avoidance goal of $150 million for its supply chain transformation effort. Under the legacy MSPV program, the National Acquisition Center tracked cost avoidance achieved by comparing prices for competitively-awarded MSPV supply contracts with prices available elsewhere. However, VHA officials stated that they are not currently tracking cost avoidance related specifically to MSPV-NG. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the VHA Chief Procurement and Logistics Officer, in coordination with SAC, should calculate cost avoidance achieved by MSPV-NG on an ongoing basis. VA agreed with this recommendation and reported it would develop a new metric to measure cost avoidance by June 2018. By following these practices, these hospital networks have reported they have achieved significant cost savings in some cases, and the potential for improved patient care, while maintaining buy-in from their clinicians. VHA’s implementation of the MSPV-NG program office has taken some steps to incorporate greater clinical involvement in subsequent requirements development, but both its requirements development and SAC’s contracting efforts have been hampered by staffing and schedule constraints. In the fall of 2016, the program office began to establish panels of clinicians to serve on MSPV-NG integrated product teams (IPT) assigned to the task of developing updated requirements for the second phase of the formulary. Program officials said they had difficulty recruiting clinicians to participate. We found that slightly more than half (20 of the 38) of the IPTs had begun their work to review items and develop updated requirements by the time the MSPV-NG program launched in December 2016. Staff on the IPTs had to complete their responsibilities by the end of March 2017 while simultaneously managing their regular workload as physicians, surgeons, or nurses. By early March 2017, the IPTs still had about 4,200 items to review. Faced with meeting this unrealistic time frame, the MSPV-NG program office had 9 IPT members travel to one location—with an additional 10 members participating virtually—to meet for 5 days to review the remaining items. Members told us that this time pressure limited the extent to which they were able to pursue the goal of standardizing supplies. VA did not document a clear overall strategy for the MSPV-NG.",

OMB’s data centers were closed, compared to the amounts that we reported in 2015, and more than $2 billion less than OMB’s fiscal year 2018 cost savings goal of $2.7 billion. This reduction in planned savings was the result of eight agencies reporting less in planned cost savings and avoidances in their DCOI strategic plans compared to the savings amounts previously reported to us in November 2015. The reduction also reflected the absence of cost savings information for one agency (Defense) that did not submit its strategic plan in time for our review. In addition, OMB provided guidance on how agencies should implement the requirements of FITARA. Specifically, agencies were to develop a strategic plan that included information on historical cost savings and avoidances due to data center consolidation and optimization through fiscal year 2015. This guidance stated that agency strategic plans were also to include year-by-year calculations of target and actual agency-wide spending and cost savings on data centers from a specific moment in time. Further, OMB placed greater emphasis on data center optimization when it issued memorandum M-13-09 in March 2013. Specifically, OMB stated that, to more effectively measure the efficiency of an agency’s data center assets, agencies would also be measured by the extent to which their primary data centers are optimized for total cost of ownership by incorporating metrics for data center energy, facility, labor, and storage, among other things. In addition, in May 2014, OMB issued memorandum M-14-08, which established a set of data center optimization metrics to measure agency progress, along with target values for each metric. All agencies were expected to achieve the target values by the end of fiscal year 2015. In conducting our analysis, on two occasions, we requested and received agencies’ validation of the results of our analysis of their strategic plans. Nevertheless, this total is about $1.12 billion below OMB’s goal of $2.7 billion for fiscal",
  " from the discontinued IHiS project, share them with the new project management team, and ensure lessons learned are utilized for the future EHR effort. The Coast Guard’s clinical staff perform various manual steps to process each paper health record. For example, clinical staff schedule appointments for patients using Microsoft Outlook’s calendar feature and provide the patient with paper forms for completion upon his or her arrival. In addition, clinical staff must handwrite clinical notes in the paper health record during the appointment, as well as handwrite prescriptions, among other manual processes. In response to our survey, the 12 HSWL Regional Managers identified a number of challenges that clinics and sick bays in their regions had experienced in managing and maintaining paper health records. These challenges were grouped into 16 categories. In addition, ensuring established project management and governance processes are effective, as well as documenting and sharing lessons learned, will be essential in avoiding past mistakes and helping to ensure a successful implementation of a future EHR solution at the Coast Guard. Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have. If you or your staff have any questions about this testimony, please contact David A. Powner, Director, Information Technology Management Issues, at (202) 512-9286 or pownerd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this testimony statement. In addition, the Department of Defense’s (DOD) Defense Health Agency Solution Delivery Information Technology (IT) team independently validate the IHiS timelines and the status of the project in 2015 because of the identified technical risks and concerns as to whether the system would be ready to be piloted in the fall of 2015. In this regard, 34 of the survey respondents reported that not all records from the Coast Guard legacy EHR systems were printed out and included in patients’ paper health records as required before the systems were retired. Thus, they had no way to ensure the patients’ paper records were complete. Penmanship. Among the 91 (76 percent) survey respondents that reported penmanship as challenging, several respondents noted that it is difficult for staff to read illegible handwritten medical notes. This, in turn, results in difficulty determining the accurate diagnosis, the required prescription, or a referral. Tracking medications. According to 89 (76 percent) of the respondents, it is challenging to track medications without an EHR. For example, one administrator stated that staff members rely heavily on patients to remember what medications they are taking—potentially causing harm if patients cannot remember what medications they are taking and the medications have dangerous interactions. Amount of time to manage records. According to an analysis conducted by the Coast Guard, which included obligations and expenditures from September 2010 to August 2017, the agency had obligated approximately $67 million for the IHiS project and, of that amount, had spent approximately $59.9 million at the time of its cancelation. In addition, over 2 years after the project’s cancelation, the Coast Guard continued to pay vendors. In this regard, it paid approximately $6.6 million to vendors between November 2017 and February 2018 to satisfy existing contractual obligations for services such as leased equipment that was damaged or missing; software licensing and support; a data storage center; and removal and shipment of equipment. Further, according to staff in Coast Guard’s Office of Budget and Programs, no equipment or software from the IHiS project could be reused for future efforts. The Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it effectively managed and oversaw the IHiS project prior to its discontinuance, and did not document and share valuable lessons learned from the failed project. Specifically, although the Coast Guard was to follow its System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Practice Manual to guide its management and oversight of the project, the agency could not provide complete evidence that it had addressed 15 of the 30 SDLC practices.",

According to OCMO officials, DOD ultimately concluded that potential savings opportunities identified as part of this review could not entirely be achieved through these means. As a result, we have identified some instances of DAFAs providing human resources services to DOD, and that a more consolidated service delivery model could reduce expenses, and that a more consolidated service delivery model could reduce expenses associated with overhead. The DAFAs that charge human resources customers by using a fee-for-service structure apply a certain percentage of the total cost as a “general and administrative cost” or “non-labor costs” to each customer. Additionally, WHS officials stated that the agency provides certain human resources services to all presidential appointee civilian positions across the military departments, rather than having the appointees’ military departments’ own human resources commands or personnel centers do so. However, we found that the documentation provided by OCMO officials does not demonstrate that a review and recording of DAFA services and supplies takes place through day-to-day management of the department. Moreover, DOD officials stated that the team plans to begin focusing on assessing optimal service delivery models possibly in 2019. No specific time frames for completion of this effort have been identified, and team members stated that these steps have been neither comprehensive nor routine, especially since 2012. In the current service delivery model with multiple human resources service providers, DOD agencies choose a human resources service providers. As such, DOD has not developed any internal guidance for a similar process that would allow for a more manageable approach to the requirement to review the DAFAs. As a result, team members we contacted were not aware that some DOD organizations were making potentially redundant and inefficient payments to the DAFAs, rather than by the military departments, is a more effective, economical, or efficient manner of providing those services and supplies. This information is used to develop an overall DOD time-to-hire measure of the department’s performance against the government-wide goal of 80 days to fill a job opening.

This vacancy percentage is similar to the percentages of vacancies in overseas Foreign Service positions that we reported in 2012 and 2008. According to staff at State officials, vacancies also noted that vacancies and the resulting increased workloads had created substantial stress and increased “burnout” of Foreign Service employees at the posts. They noted that these levels of stress and burnout had contributed to Foreign Service employees’ ending their overseas assignments early for medical or personal reasons. These curtailments, in turn, had increased the overall vacancies and their effects at overseas posts. According to State officials, when office management specialist positions are vacant, vacancies in Foreign Service generalist positions at overseas posts adversely affect State’s diplomatic readiness. According to State officials, the number of both staffed and vacant overseas Foreign Service positions increased between 2008 and 2018. As shown in figure 2, the number of positions staffed grew from 6,979 in 2008 to 8,574 in 2018—a more than 20 percent increase. Despite the increase in the number of positions staffed, our analysis found that as of March 31, 2018, overall, 13 percent of State’s overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant. This vacancy.",
  "Various DOJ and federal judiciary stakeholders play key roles in the federal criminal justice process, such as how these programs may or may not affect the recidivism rates of inmates. According to DOJ, in 2013, then-President Obama expressed a desire to review more petitions, and DOJ pledged to expedite the review of such petitions in order to provide them to the President for consideration. In 2012, the American Bar Association began compiling the first nationwide inventory of collateral consequences, known as the National Inventory of the Collateral Consequences of Conviction (NICCC). As of December 2017, BOP has taken steps to implement our recommendation to identify, obtain, and track data on the outcomes of RRCs and home confinement. In particular, BOP reported to us that it has developed a revised Statement of Work for use with its RRC contractors that requires the contractors to track and report quarterly to BOP on, among other things, the number of placements into and releases from RRCs and home confinement; revocations from RRCs or home confinement; and RRC and home confinement residents that have secured full, part-time, or temporary employment. In addition, we found that DOJ had not measured the outcomes or identified the cost implications of its programs. In addition, we found that DOJ had not identified the cost implications of its programs. In addition, we found that DOJ had not identified the cost implications of its programs. In addition, DOJ had not identified the cost implications of its programs. In addition, DOJ had not identified the cost implications of its programs. In addition, DOJ had not identified the cost implications of its programs. As part of its mission to protect public safety, BOP provides reentry programming that aims to facilitate offenders’ successful return to the community and reduce recidivism. These reentry programs are in line with our recommendation and we will continue to monitor their implementation. We also reported on selected stakeholders’ views. We spoke to 14 individuals who were leaders of organizations representing judges, victims of crime, and states, among others—on actions the federal government could consider to mitigate these collateral consequences. Most of the stakeholders that we interviewed—13 of 14—said it was important for the federal government to take action to mitigate federal collateral consequences for NVDC. As of December 2017, BOP has implemented two of the four recommendations and has taken action to address one other recommendation. BOP has developed a plan to evaluate its reentry programs. In June 2015, we reported that BOP had 18 reentry programs available to inmates in BOP institutions in the areas of inmate treatment and education. We found that while BOP had plans to evaluate the performance of some of its reentry programs, it did not have a plan in place to prioritize evaluations across all of these programs. As a result, we recommended that BOP include, as part of its current evaluation plan, all 18 of BOP’s national reentry programs, and prioritize its evaluations by considering factors such as resources required for conducting evaluations. In May 2016, BOP provided to us an evaluation plan that was consistent with our recommendation. BOP has continued to update the evaluation plan to reflect changes in priority. For example, the most recent plan, updated in July 2017, lists BOP’s Mental Health Step Down Unit program as its top priority, with a target evaluation date of fiscal year 2018. According to BOP, this reflects the need for analysis of services for seriously mentally ill inmates. BOP has taken steps to address the need for analysis of services for seriously mentally ill inmates. BOP has taken steps to assess costs of home confinement services. In February 2012, we reported that BOP did not know the actual cost of home confinement services. In February 2012, we reported that BOP did not know the actual cost of home confinement services. To facilitate inmates’ reintegration into society, BOP may transfer eligible inmates to community corrections locations for up to the final 12 months of their sentences. In addition, BOP had established indicators that were well-linked to these goals; however, the indicators lacked other key elements of successful performance measurement systems, such as clarity, a measurable target, or context. In addition, none of the indicators had numerical targets by which to assess whether overall goals and objectives are achieved. To address this deficiency, we recommended that DOJ modify its Smart on Crime indicators to incorporate key elements of successful performance measurement systems. DOJ partially concurred with the recommendation, and agreed to continually refine and enhance the indicators to improve their clarity and context. In June 2015 and June 2016, we reported that in part to help address challenges associated with overcrowding in certain institutions and related costs of incarceration, DOJ had taken steps to reduce the prison population by pursuing initiatives to: use alternatives to incarceration for low-level nonviolent crimes; prioritize prosecutions to focus on serious cases; and commute, or reduce, sentences of qualified federal inmates. In these reports, we highlighted potential areas for continued oversight of these initiatives and made six recommendations. DOJ concurred with five of",

SBA stated that this criterion was used for a borrower who was no longer a start-up but had experienced fluctuations in cash flow due to relocation or change in ownership. Another lender stated that the criterion was used more frequently during the 2007-2009 financial recession to extend financing to borrowers whose owners had experienced a home foreclosure but were otherwise sound. In relation to a footnote in our report that mentions two lender reviews, SBA did not have good information to help explain why so many lenders are not in compliance. As a result, SBA’s ability to take informed and effective actions to improve lender compliance with the requirement and ensure that the program is reaching its intended population. As shown in figure 1, almost two-thirds of loan dollars guaranteed under the 7(a) program for this period went to small businesses and provided specific reasons for not granting the desired credit. As shown in figure 2, SBA could analyze lenders’ use of the criteria along with lender review results and other data on loan characteristics and performance to determine whether certain patterns indicate that a lender might be applying the requirement inconsistently. Additionally, SBA cannot readily aggregate information on lenders’ credit elsewhere criteria. SBA has provided multiple training presentations to SBA staff, lenders, and trade associations on the statutory changes to the credit elsewhere requirements and standard operating procedure updates. These have included a presentation at a trade association conference, four monthly conference calls for SBA staff, and two conference calls for SBA lenders. SBA staff said SBA also plans to hold monthly training sessions with SBA field offices, quarterly training sessions with the industry, and at least four training sessions in 2018 at lender trade conferences. Additionally, we interviewed representatives including those at SBA’s Office of Capital Access and Office of Credit Risk Management on lender oversight and lender review processes.

The Secretary of the Senate and the LD-203 report, we asked the lobbyists or organizations to explain why the contribution was not listed on the LD-203 report or to provide documentation of those contributions. As with the LD-2 reports, we cannot be certain that our review identified all cases of FEC-reportable contributions that were inappropriately omitted from a lobbyist’s LD-203 report. We did not estimate the percentage of other non-FEC political contributions that were omitted because they tend to constitute a small minority of all listed contributions and cannot be verified against an external source. In addition, table 6 shows that about 47 percent (1,741 of 3,716) of the lobbyists had come into compliance by filing their reports or are no longer registered as a lobbyist. About 53 percent (1,966 of 3,716) of the referrals are pending further action because USAO could not locate the lobbyist. We asked for an explanation at the interview with the lobbying firm to ensure that our research was accurate. In previous reports, we reported the lower bound of a 90 percent confidence interval to provide a minimum estimate of omitted covered positions and omitted contributions with a 95 percent confidence level. We did so to account for the possibility that our searches may have failed to identify all possible omitted covered positions and contributions. As we have developed our methodology over time, we are more confident in the comprehensiveness of our searches for these items. Lobbyists for an estimated 93 percent of LD-2 reports filed year-end 2016 for all lobbyists listed political contributions on the report as required. Figure 9 shows that lobbyists for most lobbying firms filed contribution reports as required in our sample from 2010 through 2017. All individual lobbyists and lobbying firms reporting lobbying activity are required to file LD-203 reports semiannually, even if they have no contributions to report, because they must certify compliance with the LD-2 reporting requirements. To describe the resources and authorities available to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) and its efforts to improve its LDA enforcement, we interviewed USAO officials.

These efforts do not directly focus on improving water quality, but activities implemented through these efforts may indirectly improve water quality in the Columbia River Basin. According to a Congressional committee report accompanying the bill, a main finding was that while EPA in 2006 recognized the Columbia River Basin as one of the nation’s largest aquatic ecosystems and had in place an organizational structure to manage restoration efforts, the Columbia River Basin was one of the nation’s largest aquatic ecosystems.

We also conducted a literature review of nutrient credit trading programs in 2014. The state data for 2014 showed that the amount of nutrient credits purchased in these three programs was generally small. These limits establish a baseline that credit generators must discharge below before they can sell credits. According to EPA guidance, point sources that exceed their discharge limit can buy credits to be compliant with their permits, and point sources that have discharged below their limits can sell credits. Because the Clean Water Act does not require nonpoint sources to meet nutrient requirements, there is no demand to buy credits. However, in 2014, point sources and nonpoint sources may generate credits to sell to point sources for compliance with permit limits. The Clean Water Act does not specifically authorize water quality trading, according to EPA officials; however, EPA has developed trading guidance for states interested in developing trading programs. We reviewed this guidance, specifically, EPA’s 2003 Water Quality Trading Policy and the 2007 Water Quality Trading Toolkit for Permit Writers. According to the EPA toolkit, states have the flexibility to structure a trading program to meet state needs including the type of discharge limits for nitrogen and phosphorus credits. A state’s watershed implementation plans, that identify trading program rules, and interviewed state officials and other stakeholders for our nongeneralizable sample of three nutrient credit trading programs. In our interviews we asked state officials how they oversee their trading programs. In particular, we asked how they approve point and nonpoint sources to generate credits, verify that a credit represents a real reduction in nutrient pollution, and monitor the buying and selling of credits to ensure that permit obligations are met. For these three programs, we reviewed state laws and regulations, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, which allow for trading because these permits could be considered more complicated, controversial, or challenging, according to EPA officials. In the states we reviewed, officials told us that EPA has reviewed NPDES permits that allow for trading and has at times requested that states make changes to the permits. According to EPA officials and data, however, there has been limited state progress in the",

During these inspections, a TSA inspection team examines each air carrier’s implementation of applicable security requirements, including their TSA- approved security programs, any amendments or alternative procedures to these security programs, and applicable security directives or emergency amendments. In light of the situation, TSA decided in September 2017 to renew the amendments to air carriers’ programs allowing them to continue utilizing flight schedule data to more reliably track air carriers’ public charter operations between the United States and Cuba. These new amendments will expire in September 2019, at which point TSA, air carriers, and the Government of Cuba may revisit the GSC issue. In general, TSA’s procedures require it to conduct air carrier inspections at each airport on an annual or semi- annual basis depending on the airport’s vulnerability level, with some exceptions. In carrying out this function, the statute identifies measures that the Secretary must take in the event that he or she determines that an airport is not maintaining and carrying out effective security measures based on TSA assessments which can include, in some cases, revoking the authority of U.S. carriers to operate at the airport. When we identified discrepancies in the documentation for TSA’s Cuban airport assessments or air carrier inspections in Cuba, TSA will be at risk of continuing to fall short of its stated goal of completing 100 percent of required air carrier inspections and, therefore, cannot ensure that all air carriers are implementing TSA security requirements. To implement their TSA-approved security programs, TSA’s standard operating procedures. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The first foreign airport assessment after regularly scheduled commercial air service resumed was conducted in Sierra Maestra Airport in Manzanillo, Cuba on October 19, 2016, and the first air carrier inspection after scheduled commercial service commenced was conducted for an American Airlines flight on October 24, 2016, at Juan Gualberto Gomez International Airport in Varadero.

DLA Document Services does not routinely collect these data as it does for other mission specialties. According to a DOD CIO official, the responsibility for the memorandum is not clearly assigned to a member of the CIO staff. According to a DOD Comptroller official, the Financial Management Regulation provides flexibility in how obligations are categorized and reported internally and to Congress, but DOD has not evaluated options to report more accurate funding information on its document services. This analysis does not allow us to conclude which sources provide the greatest value. However, it illustrates differences in the cost of print devices across sources. In obtaining document services from DLA, DOD components—including the military services—use annual appropriations and their own working capital funds to reimburse the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. This is because DOD is taking important steps to address congressional concerns about its spending on document service activities. Most notably, DOD is implementing its plan to provide data on the cost of multifunction devices purchased by Army customers. Instead, they provided us with documentation of vendor responses to requests for quotes from the Army’s mandatory source for print devices from April 2017 through January 2018. We reviewed those documents and assigned DLA Document Services as the exclusive source for acquiring and sustaining print devices for the Navy and Marine Corps. In addition, both the Army and Air Force have established their own contracts. DOD could further reduce overlap in print device procurement by assessing the various approaches employed by DLA Document Services, which—according to internal DOD analyses—would save millions of dollars annually. DOD has set goals intended to reduce the number of print devices and realize tens of millions of dollars in savings each year, but it has not demonstrated that it has achieved these savings, because of limitations in internal controls. DOD, including the military services, has also taken steps to reduce the cost and number of office-level print devices, including identifying goals for reducing the number of print devices and plans for each military service to establish a mandatory source (e.g., one particular contract or organization) for obtaining print devices. The Army and Air Force have each established their own service-wide contracts for obtaining print devices and have mandated their use, while the Department of the Navy has mandated their",
  "We found that CBP and ICE are aware of the risks associated with counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods may also lack key elements of certification markings and other identifiers. For example, on a counterfeit phone charger we purchased, the UL certification mark did not include all components of the authentic mark. Figure 1 shows examples of these counterfeit items. Figure 1 shows examples of these counterfeit items. The risks associated with the types of counterfeit goods we purchased can extend beyond the infringement of a company’s IPR. For example, a UL investigation of counterfeit iPhone adapters found a 99 percent failure rate in 400 counterfeit adapters tested for safety, fire, and shock hazards and found that 12 of the adapters tested posed a risk of lethal electrocution to the user. Similarly, according to a rights holder representative, counterfeits of common consumer goods, such as Yeti travel mugs, may contain higher-than-approved concentrations of dangerous chemicals such as lead, posing health risks to consumers. According to ICE, seized counterfeit cosmetics have been found to contain hazardous substances, including cyanide, arsenic, mercury, lead, urine, and rat droppings. Representatives of rights holders and e-commerce websites whom we interviewed reported taking independent action to try to protect IPR within their areas of responsibility. For example, both rights holders and e- commerce websites maintain IPR protection teams that work with law enforcement to identify and remove counterfeit goods from the marketplace. However, according to CBP officials, there are legal limitations to the amount and type of information they can share, particularly if the e-commerce website is not listed as the importer on forms submitted to CBP. Several private sector representatives stated that receiving additional information from CBP would enhance their ability to protect IPR. When selling online, counterfeiters may post pictures of authentic goods on the websites where they are selling counterfeits and may post pseudonymous reviews of their products or businesses in order to appear legitimate. Additionally, by setting the price of a counterfeit at, or close to, the retail price of a genuine good, counterfeiters may deceive consumers, who will pay the higher price because they believe the goods are real or who believe that they are getting a slight bargain on genuine goods. According to CBP seizure data and CBP officials, the volume, variety, and methods of shipment of counterfeit goods seized by CBP and ICE have changed in recent years. These steps include, for example, buying only from authorized retailers online, avoiding prices that look “too good to be true,” and reporting counterfeit purchases. According to CBP officials, CBP is reviewing options for sharing additional information with rights holders and e-commerce websites and is assessing what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities. CBP officials stated that they have not yet determined whether changes to the amount and types of information provided to e-commerce websites would require regulatory changes or additional legal authorities. These officials also said that they have discussed differences in CBP’s and ICE’s information sharing with CBP officials. In addition, according to CBP data we reviewed and officials we spoke to, the methods of importing counterfeit goods into the United States have changed in recent years. Specifically, express carriers and international mail have become the predominant form of transportation for IPR-infringing goods entering the United States, constituting approximately 90 percent of all IPR seizures in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, according to CBP data. In an attempt to illustrate the risk that consumers may unknowingly encounter counterfeit products online, we purchased a nongeneralizable sample of four types of consumer products—shoes, travel mugs, cosmetics, and phone chargers—from third-party sellers on five popular e-commerce websites. According to CBP data we reviewed and officials we spoke to, CBP often seizes IPR-infringing counterfeits of these types of products. As table 1 shows, the rights holders for the four selected products we purchased determined that 20 of the 47 items were counterfeit. We did not identify any clear reasons for the variation among the counterfeit and authentic items that we purchased based on the products that they represented, the e-commerce websites where we bought the items, or the third-party sellers from whom we bought them. For three of the four product types, at least one item we purchased was determined to be counterfeit, with results varying considerably by product. Representatives of the rights holders also could not provide a specific explanation for the variation among authentic and counterfeit goods that we received. They noted that the results of covert test purchases can fluctuate depending on enforcement activities and the variety of goods and sellers on a particular website on a given day. Rights-holder testing also showed that we purchased at least one counterfeit item and one authentic item from each of the five e-commerce websites. In addition, our analysis of the customer ratings of the products we purchased determined that 20 of the 47 items were counterfeit.

DOD’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics programs have been evaluated by the Department of Defense. The program had established objective criteria for the evaluation and acceptance of requirements. Specifically, any new or updated requirements were presented to a Configuration Steering Board for review and approval prior to any changes being made. The changes consisted of a variety of reasons for the changes in planned cost estimates. For example, the program’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics program reported that it met eight of nine performance targets. According to program officials, the remaining target (i.e., network shall fully support joint critical operational activities) had not been met because the program lacked an operational platform that was required to demonstrate its performance. In addition, the policy adheres to the practice of instituting an investment board with processes for creating and defining the most appropriate technology solution that demonstrates that it can meet users’ needs. For example, the program did not indicate whether they have plans to implement this practice, and did not provide an explanation as to why they are unable to provide this information. Until the program quantifies costs and benefits, the program should have already had an approved requirements management plan in place since program initiation. In the absence of an approved plan, the program lacks assurance that it can effectively communicate and manage requirements practices. Further, the program had not demonstrated that it identified any changes that should be made to plans and work products resulting from changes to the requirements baseline. Programs officials stated that efforts to review modifications to the plan due to requirements changes had not been used as",
  ". According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard set an optimistic schedule baseline for the delivery dates for new polar icebreakers based on the ice-breaking capability gap rather than an analysis of what is realistic and feasible. Rather than building a schedule based on knowledge—such as determining realistic schedule targets and analyzing how much time to include in the schedule to buffer against potential delays, and comprehensively assessing schedule risks—the Coast Guard used the estimated end date of the Polar Star’s service life as the primary driver to set the lead icebreaker’s objective (or target) delivery date of September 2023 and threshold (latest acceptable) delivery date of March 2024. However, in our July 2012 report, we found that the Coast Guard’s assessment of the value of the Coast Guard’s fleet was based on the assumption that the Coast Guard’s fleet would be inoperable by the end of its service life. We found that the Coast Guard’s assessment of the value of the fleet was based on the assumption that the Coast Guard’s fleet would be inoperable by the end of its service life in 2006. However, based on the fiscal year 2018 through 2022 CIP, we found that the Coast Guard plans for the cutter to operate for an additional 23 years (until 2029) without any major sustainment work to extend its service life. However, this council has not carried out these portfolio-wide practices. In 2014, the Coast Guard updated the Executive Oversight Council’s charter, in response to our September 2012 recommendation, adding the responsibility for portfolio management approach, in part, will result in some of the Medium Endurance Cutters operating over 60 years, which is 30 years beyond their original design service lives. The current heavy polar icebreaker’s schedule includes only 6 months of margin between the Coast Guard’s target and latest acceptable delivery dates. However, our analysis of recent shipbuilding acquisitions shows that longer schedule delays, whether they are in the program’s control or not, should be expected. The 5-year CIP is the Coast Guard’s key acquisition portfolio planning tool. However, in our July 2018 review, we found that shortcomings of that plan that limit its effectiveness. Specifically, we found that the Coast Guard’s 5-year CIPs continue to demonstrate a pattern of certain ineffective planning practices, such as not identifying priorities or trade-offs between acquisition programs and not providing information about the effect of current decisions on the overall affordability of the acquisition portfolio. These shortcomings limit the Coast Guard’s ability to manage the Coast Guard’s ability to manage the affordability of its acquisition portfolio. Coast Guard officials said the CIP reflects the highest priorities of the department within the given top funding level and that prioritization and trade-off decisions are made as part of the annual budget cycle. However, the reasoning behind these decisions, and the resulting impacts on affected programs, are not articulated in the CIPs. While the Coast Guard is not required under statute to identify the effects of trade-off decisions in the CIP, failing to show which acquisitions would take on more risk—such as delays to certain recapitalization efforts—so other acquisitions can be prioritized and adequately funded within budget parameters also makes it difficult for Congress and other stakeholders, such as Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to understand any other options the Coast Guard considered. The Coast Guard has a history of using its annual budgets to plan its acquisition portfolio, which leads to ever changing priorities and creates deferred acquisitions and a bow wave of future funding requirements. This bow wave has begun and the Coast Guard will continue to add to it until it begins to have a longer-term focus, such as with the creation of the 20-year Long Term Major Acquisition Plan that we recommended in 2014. In our July 2018 report on Coast Guard recapitalization efforts, we recommended that the Coast Guard work with Congress to include a discussion of the acquisition programs it prioritized and describe how trade-off decisions made could affect other acquisition programs in the Coast Guard’s annual 5-year CIP. DHS agreed with our recommendation and plans to include additional information in future CIP reports to address how trade-off decisions could affect other major acquisition programs. The Coast Guard plans to implement this recommendation by March 2020. In June 2014, we found that the Coast Guard needed to take a more strategic approach in managing its acquisition portfolio. We recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that would identify all acquisitions necessary for maintaining at least its current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to build these assets. DHS concurred with this recommendation and the Coast Guard is in the process of developing a 20-year Long-Term Major Acquisitions Plan to guide and manage the affordability of its acquisition portfolio, but DHS has not yet approved the plan. Further, Coast Guard officials have stated that if the Offshore Patrol Cutter program experiences any delays, it will likely decrease",

In addition, the agency has made 20 direct clinical care selections, of which 15 have entered on duty. In addition, the agency has worked with HRSA to increase the number of facilities deemed medically underserved and therefore designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. According to IHS officials, the accuracy of the data is verified quarterly by regional human resources officers. As the IHS health care workforce also includes Commissioned Corps officers—who have a separate personnel system—the information on Commissioned Corps officers to alternate duty stations as needed; and contracts with temporary providers. IHS’s telehealth services include two agency-wide programs that provide teleophthalmology and telebehavioral health services. Teleophthalmology. The IHS facilities have entered into long-term contractual agreements with two academic fellowship programs—University of California-San Francisco Health Program and the University of Utah Global Health Fellowship. Officials told us that providers who are non-native or are not married to a tribal member generally must go off the reservation to find housing if it is not provided by IHS. According to IHS officials, the agency funds two medical students enrolled at the Uniformed Service University of the Health Sciences each year. While IHS may seek approval from HHS to exceed the maximum salary of certain pay tables, IHS officials said the approval process can be lengthy, which has resulted in the loss of promising candidates—including emergency medicine, general surgery, radiology, and anesthesiologist providers. Similarly, officials from one area office stated that 24 fellows were placed in Navajo-area facilities in 2017 at costs substantially lower than that of locum tenens contracts. According to IHS, the Great Plains area office has collaborated with the University of Washington’s global health fellowship program to assign global health fellows in Internal Medicine to Pine Ridge Hospital for 11- month placements. IHS officials stated that patients appreciate the telebehavioral services in the 8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities. IHS also offers a Virtual Internship program through a partnership with the Department of State. Virtual interns spend 10 hours a week from September through May working remotely on their projects, which have included producing bilingual Navajo and English videos for rural health clinics, developing Navajo-specific health education materials on palliative care,",

HHS-OIG is required to determine if the entity is required to comply with the terms of its agreement. HHS-OIG officials said that HHS-OIG officials typically conduct the site visit—the agreement’s monitor and one other official—and the site visits typically last about one day to a day-and-a-half. Of the 652 agreements from July 2005 through July 2017, 619 were paired with a DOJ settlement, while 33 were the result of HHS-OIG independently exercising its exclusion authority. HHS-OIG officials conducted 211 site visits that were associated with 155 agreements. Thirty of these agreements were associated with more than one site visit ranging from 2 to 10 visits. These four categories are (1) the nature and circumstances of the conduct; (2) conduct during the government’s investigation; 3) whether the entity has made efforts to improve its conduct; and 4) the entity’s history of compliance. According to HHS-OIG officials, this is because, over time, the agency has increasingly focused its resources on entities that present the highest risk of potential fraud. Specifically, HHS-OIG officials said that in 2006 they first imposed a monetary threshold for damages caused to federal health care programs, above which the agency would pursue an agreement. According to officials and as outlined in agreements, HHS-OIG often concludes that exclusion is not necessary, so long as the entity will enter into an agreement. In such situations, HHS-OIG considers what other unilateral monitoring steps it can take to impose greater scrutiny. For example, according to HHS-OIG guidance, the agency has audited, evaluated, or investigated entities after fraud settlements when the entity would not enter into an agreement with HHS-OIG and it has made referrals to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for claims reviews. Steps HHS-OIG takes to address noncompliance may include: Working with the entity before taking official action. For example, officials told us that monitors typically request additional documentation or information from providers when they identify potential issues rather than imposing stipulated penalties immediately. Demanding that the entity pay stipulated penalties. HHS-OIG will send a stipulated penalties demand letter to an entity in accordance with the breach and default terms of the agreement. HHS-OIG will release its exclusion authority without imposing additional requirements. Specifically, HHS-OIG will release its exclusion authority without imposing additional requirements. Specifically, HHS-OIG may do this in situations in which the entity has self-disclosed the fraudulent conduct to HHS-OIG or has agreed to integrity obligations with a state or the DOJ that HHS- OIG has determined are sufficient. In situations in which HHS-OIG is evaluating whether to exercise its permissive exclusion authority, DOJ is often separately negotiating a settlement of the civil and/or criminal case against the entity on behalf of the federal government. Typically, such settlements resolve allegations that the entity is liable under the False Claims Act for submitting false claims to federal health care programs. According to HHS-OIG officials, if there is a related DOJ civil or criminal case and HHS-OIG officials are also negotiating a claims review. Fifteen of these were annual claims reviews and HHS-OIG officials are also negotiating an agreement with the entity in lieu of exclusion, the DOJ and HHS-OIG negotiations often occur at the same time or “on a parallel track.” However, according to these officials, while HHS-OIG and DOJ officials share information as needed, each engage in separate negotiations with the entity. According to HHS-OIG officials, the current practice is to negotiate 3-year terms for IAs and 5-year terms for CIAs. HHS-OIG has developed agreement templates that include standard provisions to address the risks an entity’s noncompliance could pose to federal health care programs. Additionally, in some templates, provisions are included to address the specific types of conduct that gave rise to the agreement. According to HHS-OIG, HHS-OIG has four templates for use in negotiating CIAs and two for negotiating IAs, and HHS-",

  ", objectives, and outcomes. In its comments, reproduced in appendix IV, State concurred with our two recommendations. State noted that it plans to develop an updated Results Framework for CBSI that will provide the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of CBSI activities. State also noted that USAID’s Office of International Cooperation (OIC) and the Office of International Cooperation (OIC) are the primary sources of funding for CBSI activities. In addition, USAID’s Office of Western Hemisphere Programs is working through its existing monitoring and evaluation contract to improve centralized data collection and is developing plans for an enhanced data management system that will facilitate the collection and management of both strategic and implementer-reported data. In each of the CDCS, USAID outlines three development objectives, including one that is CBSI-related—on crime prevention and reduction— and two that are not CBSI-related—on climate change and health care. According to INL and USAID officials, coordination of CBSI activities between the two agencies primarily occurs at the embassy level through routine meetings. The assessment noted that coordination and information exchange between the agencies about individual CBSI activities and their components appeared to be relatively ad hoc and was primarily seen as the mandate of staff in the field, though at that level, information sharing and coordination had been widely variable. It noted that in general, the level and type of communication between USAID and INL tended to be influenced by the level of coordination between the two agencies, and the level of coordination between the two agencies was not consistent with the level of coordination between the two agencies, and the level of coordination was not consistent with the level of coordination between the two agencies. The assessment concluded that there was a potential for overlap between USAID and INL and recommended that USAID and INL take several actions to identify the underlying causes of crime and violence by collecting standardized crime data across the region. In response to these concerns about program monitoring, the United States has created several initiatives to engage with the countries of the Caribbean Basin region to address economic and political issues. The United States and USAID typically use Integrated Country Strategies (ICS) to support public safety and security activities by funding training and support programs that aim to build institutional capacity for police and judicial systems.

U.S. agencies have provided the most CBSI funding to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the countries covered by the Eastern Caribbean embassy. These countries received approximately 66 percent of total CBSI allocations from fiscal years 2010 through 2018. We analyzed these data to determine allocations, unobligated balances, unliquidated obligations, and disbursements by fiscal year, funding account, and country. We compared the data to those previously reported to identify inconsistencies, and interviewed State and USAID officials. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for reporting allocations, unobligated balances, unliquidated obligations, and disbursements by fiscal year, funding account, and country. In the absence of centrally-available, reliable data for CBSI activities, INL may continue to struggle with effective program monitoring for these activities. The United States and Caribbean countries meet periodically to set strategic goals and to designate high-level priorities for the subsequent year, and U.S. agencies individually plan and report on CBSI activities on a country-specific basis through a variety of reporting mechanisms. According to State officials, INL has an average of 10-50 distinct ongoing activities within any individual country program at any given time, ranging from multi-year, multi-million dollar embedded advisory programs to one-time procurements for equipment or individual trainings. Of the 13 CBSI partner countries, U.S. agencies have provided the most CBSI funding to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the countries covered by the Eastern Caribbean embassy. State and USAID disbursed funds to support activities in the three CBSI activities. State primarily focuses on funding CBSI activities that fall within the pillar of reducing illicit trafficking, and USAID concentrates on funding activities within the pillar of promoting social justice. These activities are generally aligned with the three pillars of CBSI. From fiscal years 2010 through 2018, State and USAID allocated more than $560 million in funding for CBSI activities. Of that amount, U.S. agencies have disbursed or committed approximately $361 million for CBSI activities in the 13 CBSI activities and for region-wide activities. Funding for CBSI activities comes from a combination of U. State and stated",

Classified and sensitive but unclassified reports are available to personnel with the proper clearances and need to know, upon request. We also reported on numerous sustainment challenges leading to less than desirable outcomes for F-35 warfighter readiness. As a result of past cost and schedule problems, our work has shown that the Navy has a less-capable and smaller fleet today than it planned over 10 years ago. The Navy has also received $24 billion more in funding than it originally planned in its 2007 long-range shipbuilding plan but has 50 fewer ships in its inventory today, as compared with the goals it first established. In June 2016, we reported that the naval shipyards and other depots had not implemented actions that would likely improve the cost-effectiveness of their supply operations. As of November 2018, the Navy reported that it had implemented 78 (i.e., 70 percent) of these recommendations. In addition to the cost of buying the ships and submarines to expand fleet size, the Navy will likely face affordability challenges with regard to the manning of an expanded fleet with the right number of sailors with the right mix of skills. In May 2017, we reported that the personnel costs for surface ship classes in fiscal years 2000-2015 were the largest share of total operating and support costs. In June 2018, we reported that the Navy analyze whether such a transfer of functions is warranted at the shipyards and the Navy concurred with the recommendation. We also reported that crew sizes on recently inducted ship classes grew from original projections as the Navy gained experience operating them. However, the Navy had not conducted a comprehensive analysis of transferring these functions and had provided no plans to do so. In May 2017, we reported that the Navy and Marine Corps address maintenance and supply challenges it will be difficult to meet Secretary of Defense-established mission capability goals. We reported that, from 2011 through 2014, about 28 percent of scheduled maintenance for surface combatants was completed on time and 11 percent was completed on time for aircraft carriers. We updated these data as of November 2018 to include maintenance periods completed through the end of fiscal year 2018 and found that the Navy continues to struggle to meet its mission capability targets by the end of fiscal year 2017. The memorandum established a goal of achieving a minimum of 80-percent mission readiness. The Navy and Marine Corps have been studying ship workload and revising its guidance. As of November 2018, the Navy was continuing to analyze the manpower requirements of its fleet, leading to more than 27,000 days in which ships were delayed and unavailable for training and operations as shown in figure 2 below. In addition to affecting training and operations, maintenance delays are costly. In August 2018, we reported that the Office of the Secretary of Defense has developed a Readiness Recovery Framework that the department is using to improve the availability of spare parts and evaluate the application of best commercial practices to naval aviation sustainment, among other actions. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Marine Corps have recently revised readiness goals and accompanying recovery strategies, metrics, and milestones to align with the 2018 National Defense Strategy and Defense Planning Guidance. We have ongoing work assessing DOD’s progress in achieveing its overall readiness goals. DOD’s readiness rebuilding efforts are occurring in a challenging context that requires the department to make difficult decisions regarding how best to address continuing operational demands while preparing for future challenges. Our work has shown that an important aspect of this, across all of the services, is determining an appropriate balance between maintaining and upgrading legacy aircraft fleets, with a minimum goal of 92 percent of those sailors having the right qualifications for the billet (known as fit). According to Navy officials, the Navy is for the most part meeting its fill goals Navy-wide, but has not consistently met its fit goals. However, during group discussions in November 2018 with ship crews and interviews with Navy officials in Japan, we learned that the Navy has taken steps to provide dedicated training time so its surface forces may meet existing Navy training standards and their training is certified when they deploy. However, the Navy continues to struggle with rebuilding the readiness of the existing fleet due to enduring maintenance and manning challenges. As the Navy seeks to expand its fleet by 25 percent, these challenges will likely be further exacerbated and the Navy will likely face additional affordability challenges. After the collisions in 2017, the Navy focused on training surface ship crews to its existing standards. We reported that the shipyards would be unable to support an estimated one-third of maintenance periods planned over the next 23 years. We recommended that the Navy take steps to improve its management of shipyard investments; the Navy concurred with this recommendation and we are encouraged by its response. For example, the Navy has developed a plan for the optimal placement of facilities and major equipment at each public shipyard, which the Navy estimates can ultimately increase its maintenance efficiency by reducing personnel and materiel travel by an average by",

The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued DOD Instruction 1336.5 in 2001 that described policy, responsibilities, procedures, and information requirements for perstempo reporting. However, our recommendation has not been fully implemented because DOD Instruction 1336.5 did not include guidance on managing perstempo. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has not been fully implemented because DOD Instruction 1336.5 did not include guidance on managing perstempo that states whether each service should have a goal for the maximum perstempo time for personnel, as discussed later in the report. The underlying reason that perstempo data are not reliable is that DOD has not emphasized the collection of complete and reliable perstempo data. Specifically, an official from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness told us that the office last reviewed perstempo data in 2012 and, at that time, determined that these data were not fully reliable. The official also told us that to address this challenge the office reiterated the requirement that the services must collect perstempo data consistently, such as Army rotations to a combined training center. Senior service officials also told us that the analysis had limited usefulness due to unreliable data. Although data are incomplete, our analysis of available data indicates that tens of thousands of service members are engaged in their official duties at a location or under circumstances that make it infeasible for a member to spend off-duty time in the housing in which the member resides. The law establishes thresholds for deployment perstempo events and that the Air Force does not require units to manage the assignments of their personnel to ensure that they do not spend more than 120 days on temporary duty. In the years since 2001, senior DOD leaders have expressed concern about the impact of a high pace of military operations and the high pace has continued for portions of the force. Moreover, we believe these numbers may be far higher because our analysis is limited by incomplete perstempo data as stated above. We also reported that DOD implementation and oversight of department-wide readiness rebuilding efforts did not fully include key elements of sound planning. We recommended, among other things, that DOD and the services establish comprehensive readiness goals and strategies for implementing them, as well as associated metrics that can be used to evaluate whether readiness recovery efforts are achieving intended outcomes. DOD has not established a perstempo thresholds and recordkeeping requirement, which in turn would prohibit the payment of high-deployment allowances, if the department found that the waiver is necessary in the interests of national security. In the absence of clear and specific guidance, the Navy and SOCOM have set their own thresholds. In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum that suspended the requirements to manage deployment days for service members and the payment of high- deployment allowances. As a matter of DOD policy, the memorandum did not suspend the recordkeeping requirement included in section 991 of title 10. In May 2001, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued an instruction that described policy, responsibilities, procedures, and information requirements for individual service members. However, the memorandum describes perstempo only in general terms—stating that individual service members should not serve extended periods of time away from home unless required by operational necessity. In 2009, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued another instruction, DOD Instruction 1336.07, that was focused on the reporting of perstempo and the instruction identifies responsibilities, procedures, and information- reporting requirements for perstempo. In particular, DOD Instruction 1336.07 states that the: Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness is responsible for providing overall policy guidance for service members were away from home more than 220 days in fiscal year 2016—a difference of about 13,000 personnel. Officials from the Navy and Defense Manpower Data Center were unable to explain the discrepancy. Moreover, Navy officials told us that the Navy oversees perstempo by requiring subordinate commands to obtain waivers when service members exceed 220 days in a year. However, the Navy had waivers for about 6,000 personnel in 2016, or only about one-fifth of the personnel the Navy’s own data indicated were gone more than 220 days. To address this, the Navy Personnel Command official told us that the Navy plans to establish an automated system to verify that Navy service members who have exceeded the Navy’s 220-day perstempo threshold have a waiver. In addition, a SOCOM headquarters official told us that the command does not have reliable perstempo data on its service members because of limitations in the command’s information technology system. As a result, SOCOM does not currently have the ability to determine whether its units are",

  "s marketing approval process as it applies to orphan drugs. The orphan drug marketing exclusivity incentive (a period of protection from competition) only applies to the drug’s approved indication. FDA took several steps beginning in June 2017 to improve the consistency and efficiency of these evaluations, including introducing a standard review template and guidance for completing it. The manufacturer may then apply to FDA for approval to market the orphan drug. In addition, two of four drug manufacturers we interviewed told us that their company’s drug development decisions are based on the natural history of the disease and the drug’s proposed mechanism of action, and not due to ODA incentives. In addition, several stakeholders noted non-ODA drivers of orphan drug growth, including the ability to treat rare diseases, and the ability to develop a drug that is intended to treat rare diseases. In addition, several stakeholders noted that OOPD’s orphan drug development process is not consistent with the regulatory requirements for orphan drug development. In addition, several stakeholders noted that OOPD’s orphan drug development process is not consistent with the regulatory requirements for orphan drug development. In addition, OOPD’s orphan drug development process is not consistent with the regulatory requirements for orphan drug development. In addition, OOPD’s orphan drug development process is not consistent with the regulatory requirements for orphan drug development. In addition, OOPD’s orphan drug development process is not consistent with the regulatory requirements for orphan drug development. In addition, OOPD’s orphan drug development process is not consistent with the regulatory requirements for orphan drug development. In addition, OOPD’s orphan drug development process is not consistent with the regulatory requirements for orphan drug development. In addition, OOPD’s orphan drug development process is not consistent with the regulatory requirements for orphan drug development. In addition, OOPD had amassed a backlog of 138 applications that were pending review for more than 120 days. The modernization plan therefore established two goals: (1) eliminating the backlog of designation applications, including that the manufacturer did not provide sufficient or adequate data to support their scientific rationale, and (2) ensuring that new designation applications are reviewed within 90 days of receipt. To accomplish its first goal, the modernization plan outlined seven actions FDA planned to take to support development of drugs that may not otherwise be profitable, as a drug manufacturer can make a return on investment from the drug from multiple patient groups rather than just one. FDA’s May 2012 publication on marketing applications between 2006 and 2010 concluded that, due to the high approval rates for applications targeting rare diseases in its study, increased efforts in the agency’s review process would be unlikely to substantially increase the number of new rare disease drugs. FDA officials told us OOPD also subsequently received reviewer assistance from the Office of Medical Products and Tobacco. FDA’s patient engagement programs have also focused on rare disease drug development. As of February 2016, the agency reported that nearly half of patient-focused drug development meetings—meetings to obtain the patient perspective on specific diseases and their treatments—have been focused on rare diseases. In addition, we found that 19 of 148 review templates did not capture all prior orphan designations for the drug and disease. In one case, the OOPD reviewer did not record any prior orphan designations for the drug in the review template and placed the designation application in pending status due to concerns with the manufacturer’s population estimate. However, the evaluation plan outlined eight steps the agency planned to take to improve the efficiency of its application review process. For example, OOPD implemented a standard review template in October 2017 that it had developed under the modernization plan’s first goal to address the backlog of applications. This template outlines information that reviewers are supposed to record, as applicable, from each application and evaluate when making a designation decision—namely, the (1) background information, (2) clinical superiority analysis, (3) orphan subset analysis, (4) population estimate, and (5) scientific rationale that the drug may effectively treat the disease. (See fig. 1.) FDA’s marketing approval process is the same for all drugs, regardless of orphan status. (See fig. 1.) The majority (61.5 percent) of orphan drug marketing approvals from 2008 to 2017 have been for a new drug not previously approved for any use, while the remainder (38.5 percent) have been for a new indication for a drug previously approved to treat a rare or non-rare disease. The two barriers to rare disease drug development most commonly cited among stakeholders we interviewed were (1) the need for more basic scientific research (e.g., understanding patient experiences and progression of symptoms, known as a disease’s natural history), and (2) the difficulty in recruiting small populations for clinical trials. One drug manufacturer explained that, when a disease affects a small population, it is hard to identify and recruit participants, because they may be geographically dispersed or have to travel long distances",
  "at the suggestion of the Air Force—to a different radio with similar features that is sold commercially to the public. According to the contracting officer, the Navy obtained information from the Air Force, which was procuring the same radio and which had performed a review in January 2017 that it shared with the Navy. Contractor representatives cited multiple reasons why they were unable to provide data (see text box). Examples of Reasons Contractors Cited for Not Providing Data: One prime contractor told us that some subcontractors are unwilling to provide information, such as unredacted invoices, to them and therefore prime contractors cannot provide this information to the government. In the end, the DCMA’s Commercial Item Group officials completed an on-site review of the manufacturing process to gain an in-depth understanding of the services provided. The contracting officer determined this support was not sufficient for determining commerciality. In addition, the contracting officer was unable to provide information on the commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. In contrast, for a previous report on commercial item acquisitions, we reviewed selected Air Force contracts for information technology services and video teleconferencing design and installation. Because these items and services are available in the commercial marketplace, the availability of information helped the contracting officers efficiently determine that the items were commercial and that the prices were fair and reasonable. Contracting officials from our case studies had difficulty obtaining information from contractors after they could not find adequate information in the marketplace. This difficulty occurred for a number of reasons, including the contractor’s inability to provide information about the commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. While several of the contracts we reviewed showed that either the prime contractor or subcontractor were unable to provide information about the commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. When contracting officers were unable to provide information about the commercial item and price reasonableness determinations, they were unable to provide information about the commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. While several of the contracts we reviewed showed that either the prime contractor or subcontractor eventually provided sufficient information, obtaining this information was not without difficulties. When dealing with a limited marketplace and price data, the subcontractor had difficulty providing detailed cost data for the government’s units because they are procured on the same manufacturing line as their commercial units. According to contractor officials, the procurement officer must determine in writing whether a product or service being procured is commercial, and 2. the contracting officer must determine if the offered price is fair and reasonable. According to the DOD Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items, the government’s ability to obtain information about commercial item and price reasonableness determinations did not ultimately affect the government’s ability to award the contract as planned. As our findings show, DOD has made some efforts to facilitate the sharing of information, such as establishing the DCMA Commercial Item Group. This group, in turn, set up a database to increase the accessibility and utility of commercial and pricing data. In most of our case studies, contracting officers said that this time did not solely affect the contract award because other factors, such as staff changes or awarding multiple contracts at the same time, also delayed the process. When determining a fair and reasonable price, market research should be conducted in order to compare the proposed price to market pricing. Figure 1 illustrates the process contracting officers generally follow to make commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. In one example, an Army contracting officer told us that a contract award was delayed when a subcontractor did not provide information to the contractor to support its commerciality assertion. The contracting officer noted that this delay also placed the program at risk of a funding loss because the service reallocated funding to another program that it viewed as less risky. The commercial item definition includes some types of items evaluated and not the results of recommendations made on commerciality by the DCMA Commercial Item Group. These recommendations can be obtained by contacting the office directly. DCMA officials stated results of their recommendations are specifically not included in the public database because of concerns that a prime contractor may prefer a subcontractor with a commercial item determination over another without one. Several contractor representatives we spoke with also told us that they have an internal panel of experts review commercial item and price reasonableness assertions to ensure consistency and that the assertions meet federal regulations. The contractors’ hope is that these forms and processes will help reduce the back and forth in requesting information among the government, prime contractor, and subcontractors. In addition, some contractor representatives told us that they work with the DCMA Commercial Item Group to better understand what information contracting officers are requesting and to obtain assistance with subcontractors that are unwilling to provide information to the prime contractor. Some contracting officers told us that they have few options at their disposal when they have difficulty obtaining information from the contractor to make a commercial item or price reasonableness determination in a sole-source environment. For example: For a $2 million Army task order for engineering services to upgrade navigation software and several GPS units with these upgrades, the contracting officer stated that the",
  "Additionally, we found that while CMS provided information on the number of abortions eligible for federal funding, it did not provide information on the number of abortions eligible for federal funding. While there were more studies on waiting periods, the results were similarly mixed, with at least one study suggesting that the type of waiting period could change the effect on access. Specifically, among the 15 states reporting information on denials of payment for abortions in circumstances eligible for federal funding, denial rates ranged from 4 percent to nearly 90 percent, with about half of the 15 states reporting denial rates of 60 percent or more. While we did not ask states to report on their reasons for denying Medicaid payment for abortions, some states provided this information. Because over 60 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries in five of these states are enrolled in MCOs, information was not available for a significant portion of their beneficiaries. In responding to our survey, 29 states reported limiting abortion coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries to the three circumstances required under federal law—rape, incest, and life endangerment—while 21 states reported broader abortion coverage. The remaining state, South Dakota, reported that it limits abortion coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries to circumstances when the pregnancy endangers the life of the woman, and does not cover abortions in cases of rape or incest. CMS confirmed that South Dakota’s Medicaid state plan does not include coverage of abortions in cases of rape or incest, and shared a letter it sent to the state in 1994 outlining that such coverage limits were associated with a reduction in the number of women having abortions. For example, one of these studies analyzed national data from 1985 to 2005 and found that limiting Medicaid coverage to abortions eligible for federal funding reduced a state’s abortion rate by 8 to 9 percent. In addition, six studies that examined providers’ experiences obtaining Medicaid payment for abortions corroborated many of the concerns raised by our survey. In addition, two studies examining the state’s Medicaid coverage for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. In addition, two studies examining the state’s Medicaid coverage for abortions corroborated many of the concerns raised by our selected providers. For example, one study examining abortion provider experiences in six states found that two Texas laws regulating abortion providers offered few, if any, health benefits and posed a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions. Therefore, the Court found that these two Texas laws constituted an undue burden and were unconstitutional. For example, one of CMS’s studies on the number of abortions available for federal funding in the United States. In addition, CMS’s studies on the number of abortions available for federal Medicaid in the United States. In addition, the studies we reviewed examined some of these factors more than others, but often pointed to the challenges they could pose. Medicaid beneficiaries may experience further challenges accessing abortions in some states due to variation in Medicaid abortion coverage and related payment requirements. We identified seven key factors as potential challenges to women accessing abortions based on our interviews with eight selected providers: (1) gestational limits; (2) mandatory counseling; (3) out-of-pocket costs; (4) parental involvement; (5) provider availability; (6) stigma and harassment; and (7) waiting periods. (See table 1.) The extent to which these factors are present in a state varies. For example, one provider who did not identify stigma and harassment as a factor affecting women in the state it operates in noted that women from all over the country come to its clinics. The provider said this was because women see its clinics as a safer place to obtain an abortion, and we continue to believe that these recommendations remain valid. Further, due to ongoing concerns regarding the quality of abortion services, there is at least one certified Mifeprex provider in every state. Surgical abortions, which can involve different procedures depending on the stage of a women’s pregnancy, account for the majority of abortions in the United States. However, CMS conducts quarterly reviews of the CMS-64 data states report. CMS officials also said that reviewers are not required to confirm whether states that report no abortions on line 14 have accurately reported the information, which means that reviewers may not identify states reporting abortions elsewhere. In the case of South Dakota, CMS is aware that the state does not cover abortions in cases of rape or incest, as required by federal law, but has not taken any action in 25 years to ensure the state’s compliance. CMS was not aware of the14 states that reported not covering Mifeprex despite the requirement to do so under federal law. Without such coverage, Medicaid beneficiaries seeking abortions in these states would have to find another way to pay for the drug or undergo a surgical abortion. In our survey, 15 states—accounting for nearly half the Medicaid population nationwide—reported that, from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, they did not claim federal funding for abortions covered by their programs. After taking these steps, 52 studies remained. The 52 studies were then reviewed and coded by analysts to determine the type of abortion access factor identified. For example. We focused",

FCC has started to allow consumers to access their subscription content via the Internet in and out of the home, on multiple devices, and when they want, for example: Many cable networks allow subscribers to MVPDs that carry that network to access live or on-demand content through an app or website specific to that network. MVPDs do not develop or control these apps and websites. Such service is often referred to as “television everywhere.” Kagan forecasts that views of Internet-based television everywhere from MVPDs will increase from approximately 5.4 billion views in 2016 to 11 billion views in 2020. All nine of the larger MVPDs we interviewed said that FCC regulations are still needed to promote consumer choice for devices. Specifically, representatives of one public interest organization we interviewed said that although the market has evolved to provide more device choices for consumers, the fact that almost all MVPD subscribers lease a set-top box shows that the intent of the Act has not yet been met. They added that while MVPDs have been increasing the development of apps for their subscribers to access content, these apps so far do not have all the functionality of leased set- top boxes, meaning that the apps are not an adequate substitute. As discussed earlier, despite the growth in apps, most larger MVPDs we interviewed still require their subscribers to have at least one set-top box. One goal of the proposed rule was to allow third party manufacturers to create new devices and user interfaces—the means through which users interact with a set-top box such as the menus, remote control, and methods of searching for programming—to access MVPD services. For such devices to work, the proposal required MVPDs to transmit to third party devices video programming content and data about that programming, including channel listings and schedules and data on what programming subscribers are entitled to access. According to representatives of one industry association we interviewed, this could have meant that MVPDs, and the programmers whose content they distribute, would lose control over content that they had created or",

  "According to Air Force officials, fielding schedule changes could also put at risk the ability to provide timely funding for the military construction projects necessary to house new simulators at the rescue squadrons’ bases. These officials stated that the current Combat Rescue Helicopter fixed-price contract is ahead of schedule and within budget. Figure 1 shows the Air Force’s inventory of HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters as of May 2018. Air Force officials said they expect to have new helicopters by March 2020, 3 months ahead of schedule. They also said that if changes are made to the order of deliveries under the contract, the contract would have to be renegotiated which would, in turn, likely slow the delivery of the new helicopters and increase contract costs. Air Force officials acknowledge that based on the current fielding schedule there is a potential training gap that will occur in fiscal years 2025 through 2028 when the formal training units will no longer have any HH-60Gs available to train the reserve component. As of June 2018, Air Force officials told us that the Air Force was considering a number of options to address future training issues, including the following: The Air Force would provide the Air National Guard helicopters to the Air National Guard. The Air National Guard helicopters have an average of about 6,200 flight hours while the Air Force Reserve helicopters have an average of about 5,500 flight hours. The Air National Guard helicopters have an average of about 6,200 flight hours. The Air National Guard helicopters have an average of about 5,500 flight-hours per aircraft. However, the Combat Rescue Helicopter fielding schedule shows that the Air National Guard to continue providing initial and requalification training on the legacy HH-60G helicopters for several years after the active component portion of the formal training unit at Kirtland Air Force Base has divested its legacy HH-60G helicopters. The Air Force would require personnel that have completed training on the Combat Rescue Helicopter at Kirtland Air Force Base to then receive additional training for the legacy HH-60G helicopters at their home stations if their squadrons are still flying the HH-60Gs. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. These refurbished helicopters are commonly referred to as the Operational Loss Replacement helicopters. According to Air Force officials, the Operational Loss Replacement helicopters are expected to be operational in fiscal years 2025 through 2028. The Operational Loss Replacement helicopters are expected to increase squadron helicopter reliability and are expected to reduce unscheduled maintenance until the Air National Guard squadrons receive their new Combat Rescue Helicopters. Due to the Air Force fielding schedule for the Combat Rescue Helicopters, the Air Force may face a challenge in supporting formal training for its reserve component squadrons during fiscal years 2025 through 2028. The helicopters’ mission capable rates have shown some year- to-year fluctuations, without any clear trends. However, for each of the past 5 years, the helicopters’ mission capable rates have been below the Air Force’s goal, and for fiscal year 2017, 68 percent of the 96 helicopter fleet were mission capable. As the helicopters have aged, the amount of time spent conducting maintenance on them has increased. For example, according to Air Force officials, in fiscal year 2013 the fleet averaged about 21 maintenance manhours for every HH-60G aircraft, as shown in figure 7. However, by fiscal year 2017, the maintenance time spent had increased to an average of more than 25 maintenance manhours for every flight hour. According to officials, the increased time conducting maintenance is a result of an aging helicopter that requires more intensive maintenance. Further, according to officials, in 2007 the average amount of time required to conduct more extensive depot-level maintenance was 233 days, but by fiscal year 2017 it was 332 days, more than a 40 percent increase. Air Force maintenance data for fiscal years 2013-2017 show that airframes, turboshaft engines, and flight controls (see fig. 4) were the HH-60G elements that failed most often. According to Air Force officials, these structural and major component failures can require time-consuming maintenance that negatively affects availability and mission capable rates. According to Air Force flight-hour data, the average flight hours across the HH-60G fleet have increased by nearly 20 percent from fiscal year 2013 through May 2018. Air Force officials stated that the HH-60G was initially designed to have a service life of approximately 6,000 flight hours. However, in May 2018, the fleet-wide average was approximately 7,100 flight hours, or about 18 percent more than their initial expected service life. Table 1 shows that, as of May 2018, HH-60G training aircraft averaged about 10,500 flight hours, while the primary mission and back up aircraft averaged about 6,600 flight hours. The Air Force’s primary mission and back up aircraft averaged about 6,600 flight hours. The Air Force’s primary mission and flight controls (see fig. 4) were the HH-60G elements that failed most often.",

This methodology uses an automated link from the Facilities Information System (which has the construction-in-progress account) to iNFADS. The success of this methodology will be critical for capturing capital improvements for buildings. The Navy’s policy is to capitalize buildings based on the established capitalization threshold in effect when each building was placed in service. According to Navy officials, buildings placed in service from October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2013, should have been included as assets in the financial statements if the buildings were valued at or above $20,000, so that the buildings are recorded as assets in iNFADS and removed at the end of the fiscal year. During our site visits, we also selected a nongeneralizable sample of a total of 39 buildings on Navy installations to be tested floor to book—19 from 5 Norfolk and 20 from 5 San Diego areas. We met with the RPAOs at each of the10 installations and tested by observation whether the 40 buildings selected for book-to-floor testing existed. In addition to testing for existence, we compared the descriptions of the replacement cost in current year dollars to design and construct a facility to replace an existing facility at the same location. As such, the replacement (or construction) cost factor, generally applied to buildings as a dollar amount multiplied by square footage, is also indexed to increase or decrease the amount to account for other variations in costs for different geographic areas or complexity of the facility. As a result, the RPAOs may not know of Non- MILCON buildings acquired or constructed with operations and maintenance or other Non-MILCON funding under $750,000 and accordingly do not have documentation to record the buildings’ acquisitions in iNFADS. The Navy did not adopt DOD’s $20,000 capitalization threshold and instead continued to use the $100,000 threshold, buildings placed in service in fiscal years 2008 through 2013 with a value at or above $20,000 were excluded from testing because the assets no longer existed. The Navy has efforts under way to perform asset evaluations for those buildings for which these evaluations had not been completed in a 5-year period, including using contractors to help complete the asset evaluations. As stated in DOD’s Financial Management Regulation, real property assets and capital improvements to these assets are to be capitalized as of the date each asset was",

  "ICA in the form of assistance agreements. In our December 2017 report, we reviewed 12 such agreements across the four agencies and found that State and USDA did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance. State has taken corrective action since the grants were awarded. We also found that all four agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements we reviewed. State and HHS both initiated corrective action prior to our review of the grants. The United States provided voluntary contributions to OAS, PAHO, and IICA through project-specific assistance agreements, such as grants and cooperative agreements. According to U.S. agency officials, the organizations’ regional knowledge and technical expertise make them effective implementing partners for projects serving U.S. national interests and priorities throughout the hemisphere. From calendar years 2014 through 2016, the United States provided voluntary contributions totaling about $105 million to the OAS, PAHO, and IICA, as shown in table 2. In addition, agencies may not have all the information they need to make budgetary and programmatic decisions. In our December 2017 report, we recommended that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of the agreements’ required monitoring activities. Further, if the agencies do not have full documentation of the agreements’ required monitoring activities, they may not be able to effectively manage federally funded projects that support U.S. strategic goals. In addition, agencies may not have all the information they need to make budgetary and programmatic decisions. In our December 2017 report, we recommended that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities. The agencies concurred with these recommendations and indicated that they will take actions to address them. For example, USAID said it would issue an agency notice to remind all agreement officers to maintain complete files for each agreement. Chairman Cook, Ranking Member Sires, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions that you may have at this time. In October 2013, the United States enacted the Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (Reform Act). The Reform Act directed the Secretary of State to, among other things, submit “a multiyear strategy that…identifies a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms that would lead to an assessed fee structure in which no member state would pay more than 50 percent of the OAS’s assessed yearly fees.” According to the Reform Act, it is the sense of Congress that, among other things, it is in the interest of the United States, OAS member states, and a modernized OAS that the OAS move toward an assessed quota structure that calls for agencies to conduct monitoring activities as part of their oversight of their assistance agreements. The agencies implement their guidance by including key provisions to carry out required monitoring activities as part of their agreements. Federal standards for internal control call for agencies to include in agreements all key provisions delineating the parties’ responsibilities. For the 12 agreements we reviewed, the number of key monitoring provisions per agreement varied depending on when the agency issued and updated its guidance relative to when the agreements were approved. Federal standards for internal control call for agencies to document internal controls, transactions, and significant events. Specifically, internal control call for agencies to document internal controls, transactions, and significant events. Specifically, internal control standards state that agency management should include internal control activities (e.g., monitoring activities) in policies or directives for transactions such as assistance agreements. For the 12 assistance agreements we reviewed, USDA and State did not include provisions implementing 6 of the 55 total (11 percent) monitoring activities required by applicable guidance (see table 3). For example, State did not include two of the key monitoring provisions (a risk assessment and a monitoring plan) in one of its agreements. State took corrective action in 2015 by issuing a standard operating procedure. The agencies specify the requirements to fulfill the key monitoring provisions in the individual assistance agreements, such as by requiring financial reports on a quarterly basis or including specific information in performance reports. Grants officers, if they deem it necessary or appropriate, include additional monitoring provisions requiring activities beyond those required by the applicable guidance, such as site visits. Federal standards for internal control call for agency management to design monitoring activities, such as financial and performance reporting, so that all transactions are completely and accurately recorded. Recording these activities maintains their relevance and value to management in controlling operations and making decisions. Without access to complete monitoring documentation, the agencies risk weakening the effectiveness of these controls. None of the four U.S. agencies had full documentation of all of the monitoring activities required by the OAS. In 2016, the U.S. agencies had full documentation of all of the monitoring activities required by the OAS. In 2016, the U.S. agencies had full documentation of all of the OAS",
  " time available for other units. Maintenance delays, bad weather, and transit time. Ten of 23 Marine Corps units told us that changes to an amphibious task force and a (2) landing force together with other forces that are trained, organized, and equipped for amphibious operations. The amphibious task force is a group of Navy amphibious ships, most frequently deployed as an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The landing force is a Marine Air- Ground Task Force—which includes certain elements, such as command, aviation, ground, and logistics—embarked aboard the Navy amphibious ships. A Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is the most-commonly deployed Marine Air-Ground Task Force. Together, this amphibious force is referred to as an ARG-MEU. The Navy and Marine Corps have not fully established compatible policies and procedures, such as common training tasks and standards and agreed-upon roles and responsibilities, to ensure their efforts to achieve improved naval integration are consistent and sustained. We also found that some of the Navy and Marine Corps’ systems for managing and conducting integrated training are incompatible, leading to inefficiencies in the process to manage unit-level training events. Leverage resources to maximize training opportunities. The services are looking to better leverage available training resources for amphibious operations. However, we identified examples of potential training opportunities during surface warfare tactical training and community relations events where enhancing the services’ collaborative efforts could take greater advantage of available training time for amphibious operations. Mechanisms to monitor results and reinforce accountability. The Navy and Marine Corps do not prioritize all available training resources. For Marine Corps units not scheduled for a MEU deployment, officials described an ad hoc process to allocate any remaining available amphibious ship training time among home- station units. Specifically, officials stated that the current process identifies units that are available for training when an amphibious ship becomes available rather than a process that aligns the next highest- priority units for training with available amphibious ships. The Navy and Marine have not developed mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results in improving naval integration and to align efforts to maximize training opportunities. Given the limited availability of amphibious ships for training, the Navy and Marine Corps have not systematically incorporated selected training resource alternatives into home-station training plans. Marine Corps units also train to accomplish a set of mission-essential tasks for the designed capabilities of the unit. Many Marine Corps units within the command, aviation, ground, and logistics elements have an amphibious-related mission- essential task. To be certified in the mission-essential task of amphibious operations, Marine Corps units must train to a standard that may require the use of amphibious ships. The Marine Corps’ use of virtual training devices has increased over time, and advances in technology have resulted in the acquisition of simulators and simulations with additional capabilities designed to help individual Marines and units acquire and refine skills through more concentrated and repetitive training. The Navy and Marine Corps have not developed a process or set of metrics to monitor progress toward achieving its amphibious operations training priorities and mitigating existing shortfalls. Current reporting systems do not allow officials to assess the services’ progress in achieving amphibious operations priorities or to monitor efforts to establish comprehensive amphibious operations priorities. The Marine Corps has introduced other virtual training devices to prepare Marines for operational conditions and for emerging threats, such as devices to replicate a variety of vehicles for driver training and egress trainers, among others. The Navy stated it does not utilize virtual training devices that simulate amphibious operations, including ship-to-shore movement. In our September 2017 report, we recommended that the Navy and Marine Corps develop an approach to prioritize available training resources, systematically evaluate among training resource alternatives to achieve amphibious operations priorities, and monitor progress toward achieving them. DOD concurred with our recommendation and stated that the Secretary of the Navy would develop an amphibious operations training construct capitalizing on the application of primary and alternative training resources. While the Marine Corps has stated that the use of virtual training could help mitigate some of the limitations of training in a live-only environment and taken some steps to integrate these devices into operational training, we identified gaps in its process to develop and use them. Specifically, based on our review of a selection of 6 virtual training devices, we found weaknesses in three key areas: Front-end planning. The Marine Corps’ process for conducting front- end planning and analysis to support the acquisition of its virtual training devices does not include consideration of critical factors for integrating virtual training devices into operational training, such as the specific training tasks the device is intended to address, how the device would be used to meet proficiency goals, or available time for units to train with the device. As a result, the Marine Corps does not have a reasonable basis to ensure that it is acquiring the right number and type of virtual training devices to meet its operational training needs.

  "We monitor the progress that Congress and executive branch agencies have made in addressing the issues we identified in each of our last seven annual reports. As shown in table 4, Congress and executive branch agencies have made consistent progress in addressing many of the actions we identified from 2011 to 2017. As of March 2018, 376 (52 percent) of the actions we identified from 2011 to 2017 have been fully addressed. As of March 2018, 376 (52 percent) of the actions we identified from 2011 to 2017 have been fully addressed. See our online Action Tracker for the status of all actions. The progress Congress and executive branch agencies have made in addressing our open actions has resulted in $178 billion in financial benefits, including roughly $125 billion in financial benefits from 2010 through 2017, with at least an additional $53 billion in estimated benefits projected to accrue in 2018 or later. Table 5 highlights examples of these results. These financial benefits continue to grow as we identify and document additional agency actions that respond to our recommendations. HHS also operates other public health-related agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. HHS represented about 27 percent of the fiscal year 2017 federal budget, with outlays totaling about $1.2 trillion. As of March 2018, 56 of HHS’s 111 actions remained open. Our work suggests that effectively implementing these actions, including those related to areas listed in table 8, could reduce costs, provide services more efficiently, and yield substantial financial benefits. CMS’s new policy partially responds to a longstanding recommendation we have made to better ensure that valid methods are used to demonstrate budget neutrality. HHS represented about 27 percent of the fiscal year 2017 federal budget, with outlays totaling about $1.2 trillion. As of March 2018, 56 of HHS’s 111 actions remained open. Our work suggests that the spending HHS had authorized for these demonstrations was much higher than what was justified, as HHS had allowed states to use questionable methods when proposing spending for their demonstrations. CMS’s new policy partially responds to a longstanding recommendation we have made to better ensure that valid methods are used to demonstrate budget neutrality. We anticipate that CMS’s recent actions could potentially reduce the federal government’s liability for Medicaid by billions, or tens of billions, annually. While not all actions result in financial benefits to taxpayers, all of our suggested actions, when implemented, can result in other benefits—for instance, they make government more efficient or eliminate, reduce, or improve management of fragmented, overlapping, or duplicative programs. For example, such benefits can be seen in the results of our work on the government’s acquisition of space programs. For over two decades, we and others have reported on problems caused by fragmented leadership and a lack of a single authority in oversight of these multibillion dollar programs. In 2012, we made a recommendation aimed at strengthening leadership and authority of space systems acquisitions. In response, in 2017 the President revived the National Space Council to provide a coordinated process for developing and monitoring the implementation of national space policy and strategy. Separately, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Congress made changes to certain DOD space leadership positions and required the department to conduct a review and identify a recommended organizational and management structure for its national security space components, and submit related reports. The act also required DOD to contract with a federally funded research and development center not closely affiliated with the Air Force to develop a plan to establish a separate military department responsible for DOD national security space activities. These actions could reduce fragmentation and speed decision making in the development of a substantial investment in space systems. While Congress and executive branch agencies have made progress toward addressing the 798 total actions we have identified since 2011, further steps are needed to fully address the 365 actions that are partially addressed or not addressed. We estimate that tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits could be realized should Congress and executive branch agencies fully address open actions. In addition to producing financial benefits, these actions make government more efficient; improve major government programs or agencies; reduce the risk of mismanagement, fraud, waste, and abuse; and increase assurance that programs comply with laws and funds are legally spent. Congress has used our work to identify legislative solutions to achieve cost savings, address emerging problems, and find efficiencies in federal agencies and programs. In our 2011 to 2018 reports, we directed 54 actions to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in areas that contribute to VA effectively and efficiently achieving its mission to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, and social support.

  " collect and use EAD to target mail for inspection and use EAD to target mail for inspection achieve the desired security and resource benefits. Chairman Meadows, Ranking Member Connolly, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have at this time. If you or your staff have any questions about this testimony, please contact Lori Rectanus, Director, Physical Infrastructure Issues at (202) 512-2834 or rectanusl@gao.gov. Seized items are categorized in SEACATS as either drugs or merchandise. Among the approximately 308,000 seizures, illegal or inadmissible drugs accounted for about 47 percent of total seizures and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. In fiscal years 2012 through 2015, CBP’s seizure data reflect zero seizures of fentanyl, but according to CBP, there may be additional seizures of fentanyl in the United States, and there may be additional seizures of fentanyl in the United States, and there may be additional seizures of fentanyl in the United States. In fiscal years 2012 through 2015, CBP’s seizure data reflect zero seizures of fentanyl, but according to CBP, fentanyl seizures would have been captured under other categories in SEACATS. According to CBP, a specific category code for fentanyl was added to SEACATS in fiscal year 2016. SEACATS reflects 53 seizures of fentanyl in fiscal year 2016. SEACATS reflects 53 seizures of fentanyl in fiscal year 2016 via both mail and express cargo. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both USPS and express consignment operators provide items to CBP for inspection. Express consignment operators accept items for delivery to the United States at points of sale in foreign countries and provide EAD to CBP prior to the items’ scheduled arrival in the United States. CBP then analyzes the EAD and provides lists of targeted items to express consignment operators. In our report we found that an analysis of the costs associated with planned efforts is particularly critical given USPS’s financial challenges. As we recently found, USPS reported a net loss of $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2016—its 10th consecutive year of net losses. In light of this situation, any expenditure of financial resources to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement. According to USPS data, USPS received EAD for about one third of all inbound international mail (excluding letters, flats, and military/diplomatic mail) for the period from April 2016 through March 2017. For the month of March 2017 (the most recent data available at the time of our review), USPS data indicate that EAD was available for roughly half of all inbound international mail (excluding letters, flats, and military/diplomatic mail). In 2014 and 2015, USPS and CBP initiated two pilot programs at the New York International Service Center (ISC) to target certain mail for inspection using some of the EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. At the time of our review, CBP did not use EAD to target mail for inspection outside of these pilots. According to USPS documents, the goal of these pilots is to test the effectiveness of placing holds on mail that has been targeted by CBP based on EAD. Under the pilots, CBP uses EAD to target a small number of pieces of mail each day. According to USPS officials, when USPS employees scan either individual targeted pieces or larger sacks containing this targeted mail, they are alerted that CBP has targeted the item and set the item or sack aside for inspection. If the amount of available EAD remains limited for inbound mail, this may reduce the effectiveness of CBP’s targeting efforts or could constrain CBP’s ability to reduce the volume of mail it inspects. Our prior work has found that, according to USPS and CBP, USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection because locating targeted mail once it arrives at an ISC has been a challenge. In the absence of information on the relative costs of various methods of selecting mail for inspection as well as their effectiveness at identifying potential threats in inbound mail, USPS and CBP are unable to fully understand whether obtaining additional EAD for targeting purposes will provide security or resource benefits. In our report, we therefore concluded that, particularly in light of the challenges that collecting and using EAD to target mail for inspection, USPS and CBP are unable to fully understand the costs associated with EAD. In our report, USPS and CBP are unable to fully understand whether obtaining additional EAD for targeting purposes will provide security or resource benefits. In our report, we found that, particularly in light of the challenges that collecting and using EAD, USPS employees may",

Assumptions regarding call volume to the CQA were increased by 5 percent to account for expected response by phone after the elimination of the option to save Internet responses and return to complete the form later. The Bureau also cited updated cost data and the ranges of potential outcomes, using the description provided. Bureau officials attributed this decrease to a forecasted reduction in Internet response due to added authentication steps at log in and the elimination of the function allowing users to save their responses and return later to complete the survey. Failure to document an estimate in enough detail makes it more difficult to replicate calculations, or to detect possible errors in the estimate; reduces transparency of the estimation process; and can undermine the ability to use the information to improve future cost estimates or even to reconcile the estimate with another independent cost estimate. The Bureau told us it would continue to make improvements to ensure the estimate is “not reliable.” According to Bureau documentation, this more conservative estimate is based on historical data, rather than research and test data. In-office address canvassing rates. The Bureau’s cost estimates for the 2020 Census have been updated to reflect the results of the 2015 Census. Risk and uncertainty analysis should be performed to determine the level of risk associated with the estimate. The estimate’s cost estimates need to be cross-checked, and an independent cost estimate (ICE) is conducted to see whether other estimation methods produce similar results. If any of the characteristics are not met, minimally met, or partially met, then the cost estimate does not fully reflect the characteristics of a high- quality estimate and cannot be considered reliable. We also analyzed the Bureau’s cost estimates, developed by Commerce’s Office of Acquisition Management and the Bureau’s Office of Cost Estimation and Assessment. As part of their process for finalizing the cost estimate, Bureau officials reconciled differences between the estimates in discussions with the two offices, resulting in more conservative assumptions by the Bureau around risk and uncertainty. In-field canvassing is more labor intensive compared to in office procedures. The 2017 version of the cost estimate reflects this increase in workload for in-field address canvassing, though overall changes in estimated costs were applied to the various cost elements in the estimate. Also, evidence of how variances between estimated costs and actual expenses would be tracked over time was not available at the time of our analysis. The following documents, shown in table 2, establish roles and responsibilities for oversight and approval of cost estimates, provide a detailed description of the steps taken to produce a high-quality cost estimate, and clarify the process for updating the cost estimate and associated documents over the life of a project. The Bureau, information collected from the test, such as overall response rates and the use of administrative records to inform census records, will inform future versions of the estimate. This increase in contingency can be attributed, in part, to the Bureau gaining a clearer understanding of risk and uncertainty in the 2020 Census as it approaches. The Bureau developed some of its contingency based on proven risk management techniques, including Monte Carlo analysis and allocated funding for known risk scenarios. The 2017 estimate includes close to $1.4 billion in estimated costs for these risks, almost three times the amount included in the 2015 estimate. The 2017 cost estimate demonstrates improvement over the 2015 cost estimate when the Bureau’s cost estimate only partially met the criteria for comprehensive. We found the Bureau estimated that they could conduct the operation at a cost of $12.3 billion in constant 2020 dollars. The Bureau’s latest cost estimate, announced in October 2017, reflects the same design, but at an expected cost of $15.6 billion. For our reporting needs, we also found",

The military services do not have plans to correct the discrepancies in significant data elements in their data systems that are identified by OSD’s verification and validation tool. We and the military services have identified that real property installation officials do not consistently document or enter physical inventory information into the military services’ data systems. We found during our site visits to 12 military service installations that for 21 facilities out of 106 facilities tested, real property installation officials had not entered physical inventory information in the military services’ data system within the last 5 years. Specifically, we identified inconsistencies in the military services’ recording of real property positions throughout the department, which poses a risk to data quality. For example, real property installation officials at 10 of 12 installations we visited told us that they had unfilled real property information for a variety of purposes such as prioritizing facilities for sustainment and restoration projects, preparing installation master plans, and conducting fire and safety planning. Service level. Military service headquarters and WHS use inventory information to oversee and manage their real property needs across their installations. For example, this expanded platform would replace DOD’s annual data call to the military services. The Army, Marine Corps, and Navy completed various workforce plans that found they did not have a sufficiently sized workforce to adequately maintain their real property. In addition, this information is used to account for real property assets. This would provide near real-time information to users for the department-wide management of DOD’s real property. According to OSD officials, users could also access real property information themselves and run their own data analyses when OSD expands this platform to replace the annual data call to the military services. The Navy conducted tests in June 2017, and reported 5,918 of the 34,104 assets tested had not had a physical inventory for more than 5 years. Additionally, in October 2017, the Navy reported that 9 of 41 assets it tested did not have supporting records that the inventory was performed per DOD requirements for timeliness. The Marine Corps had an external auditor conduct tests in September 2017 and reported that installation officials could not support the last physical inventory performed for 83 of 998 assets tested. The military services did not fully monitor operational status from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016 found improvements in data on surplus and disposed facilities. The Army has defined roles and responsibilities for accounting for real property, including changes to facility function (i.e., category code). The Air Force has developed overall policies and procedures for accounting for real property. However, they do not expect to fill all of their authorized positions because senior leadership has prioritized staffing at other offices and military service officials stated that they face challenges in finding qualified applicants for open positions. Despite the recognized needs, the Navy Office of Financial Operations also reported in June 2017 that 15 of 650 real property assets tested from a non- generalizable sample were reported to have been disposed of, but were not recorded as disposed of or removed from the Navy’s data system. According to an OSD official, OSD cannot direct the military services to fill their real property positions; however, OSD has not coordinated with the military services to identify opportunities to overcome unfilled positions. Potential opportunities may include using available staff more efficiently or evaluating opportunities to better address how they will manage unfilled positions. According to real property installation officials, overdue dates can occur because the physical inventory was either not conducted or the information from the physical inventory was not entered into the military services’ data systems. The military services did not report all facilities in their data systems to OSD for inclusion into RPAD. The military services did not report to OSD between approximately 40,900 facilities (6.1 percent) and",

The Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation has provided evidence that the program would not maintain an even spending rate of $45 million per month, as suggested in the program’s schedule. The program also faces risks that program officials told us lie outside the program’s direct control—such as risks related to the F-35 delivery aircraft, components that are being shared by different nuclear weapon programs (such as the weapon’s radar), and costs associated with maintenance of the B61-12. The estimate is based on a historical record of cost estimating and actual experiences from other comparable programs. Best practice The cost estimate includes a sensitivity analysis that identifies a range of possible costs based on varying major assumptions, parameters, and data inputs. They said that their use of the joint risk management process calls management attention to potentially serious risks and helps the program to manage these risks as early and as continually as possible. The program incorporated practices that substantially met the criteria for a comprehensive cost estimate, which we believe contributed to the program’s cost. The B61-12 program officials have provided information to the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation about the schedule of the B61-12 LEP. In addition, NNSA did not document the rationale for its decision to use the program’s cost estimates and its relevance to the independent cost estimate. According to B61-12 program officials, the information in the NNSA had not undertaken full-scale weapon system design activities since the 1982 design of the B61-12 and used this information as a starting point to evaluate the program’s performance. These issues include the following: The officials described the data available to the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation in August 2014 as tentative, saying that the program can now use the NNSA Integrated Master Schedule to track performance at a more detailed level. According to B61-12 program officials, the program made important decisions that affected components on the program schedule’s critical path at the time the program’s critical path. For example, the program office restructured the path to first production unit for high-level components, correcting",

The tritium sustainment program has recently met the Program Execution Instruction requirements as well, including having a program plan, work breakdown structure, integrated master schedule, and performance management approach in place. Additionally, the program recently updated documentation to meet the Program Management Policy requirements including revising its Strategic Material Mission Working Group in 2017, according to agency officials. The lithium program is early in its development, and no program manager has been appointed yet, pending senior NNSA leadership decisions. NNSA has a lithium mission strategy, a mission requirements matrix, and a technology development plan in place, as required by the Program Management Policy for Weapons and Strategic Materials, but the rest of the strategic materials programs are still in the process of being developed, according to NNSA officials.

NNSA officials said that NNSA has attempted over time to assess resource and skill needs but that these efforts have been hampered by, among other things, a lack of staff. NNSA outlined actions taken and planned to address this recommendation. NNSA’s Office of Defense Programs has set program requirements for the strategic materials programs and has established the roles and responsibilities of the programs and meeting their missions. According to NNSA officials, all of the strategic materials programs have been assigned relatively few federal staff to implement the programs. NNSA defined these program requirements in two documents issued in 2016 and 2017. Collectively these documents set documentation requirements as well as established the roles and responsibilities of the strategic materials program managers. According to NNSA officials, these requirements apply to each of the programs, including the lithium program. These requirements are outlined below. Program Execution Instruction (2016) – In January 2016, NNSA approved a Program Execution Instruction that defines requirements for the strategic materials programs. This is a significant step given the importance, cost, and complexity of these strategic materials programs. However, NNSA has made varying progress implementing these strategic materials programs, in part because these programs may not have been allotted staff and management capacity commensurate with their cost and scope of work. Although strategic materials program officials acknowledged staffing limitations, they have not determined the critical skills and competencies of the programs. NNSA has not determined the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to meet program requirements and, ultimately, achieve the programs’ missions. According to NNSA officials, these requirements apply to each of the programs, including the lithium program, relying instead on staff in other programs such as a federal program manager from a different program who acts as staff for this program; and the lithium program had the lead point of contact and no dedicated staff, although a contracted senior technical advisor provides some support. NNSA officials cited competing agency priorities and current perceived staffing limits as the primary impediments to assigning more staff to these programs. In January 2016, NNSA approved the implementation of the first part of NNSA’s new plutonium strategy: the revised CMRR project, which includes a subproject to remove contaminated equipment no longer in use in Plutonium Facility 4, install new plutonium analysis equipment, and modify an existing building to handle higher quantities of plutonium. NNSA provided written comments, which are reproduced in full in appendix II, as well as technical comments, which we incorporated in our report as appropriate. In its comments, NNSA agreed with our recommendation and stated that the strategy is consistent with the programs’ current evolution. In addition, in November 2015, DOE approved the mission need for the implementation of the second part of the strategy: building modular nuclear facilities to add high- hazard, high-security laboratory space at Los Alamos (the Plutonium Modular Approach) to meet plutonium pit production requirements. NNSA estimated that the Plutonium Modular Approach could cost from $1.3 billion to $3.0 billion and be completed by the end of 2027. According to NNSA officials we interviewed, the policy is based on NNSA’s experience in implementing the uranium program in 2014. The policy requires each of the strategic materials programs to develop a number of guidance documents, including a mission strategy, mission requirements, and a technology development plan. For each program, the policy also requires the formation of a strategic materials mission working group that is comprised of the key stakeholders involved in the program. NNSA officials told us that they are making progress in implementing the program requirements outlined for each of the strategic materials programs, although some are further along than others. However, these officials said that relatively few staff had been assigned to these programs, which has challenged implementation efforts. For its two strategic materials programs established in 2014—uranium and domestic uranium enrichment—NNSA",
  ", information technology services, and knowledge-based professional services. DOD contracting officials’ rationale for using the LPTA process, which are awarded to two or more contractors under a single solicitation. These contracts allow agencies to establish a group of prequalified contractors to compete for future orders, including for operations and support as revisions to the DFARS are considered. The FAR states that when using the LPTA process, tradeoffs are not permitted. DOD may elect to use the LPTA process where the requirement is clearly defined and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal. In such cases, DOD concurred with both of our recommendations. When a concrete need arises, a contracting officer will issue a task order for services or delivery order for products. When using the LPTA process, DOD specifies its minimum requirements in the solicitation. Firms submit their proposals and DOD determines which of the proposals meet those requirements. For example, an Army contracting official who purchased construction quality assurance and oversight services stated the concept of life-cycle costs generally applies to products, not services. Similarly, a DLA official who contracted for a de-icing agent stated that this particular product does not have life-cycle costs associated with it. Generally, a contracting officer placing an order under a multiple-award IDIQ contract and all contract holders were pre-qualified to perform the work. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-4841 or dinapolit@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. One contracting official who awarded an IDIQ contract stated this criterion would not apply to those IDIQ contracts using either the LPTA process or a tradeoff process. In other words, DOD employs both the LPTA and tradeoff processes for competitive orders issued against the same IDIQ contract, depending upon the requirement. In the two remaining cases, one contracting official stated he was not confused by this criterion, but did not consider life-cycle costs. The other contracting official stated he was not confused by this criterion, but did not consider life-cycle costs when awarding the contract to provide instructors at the Army Sergeants Major Academy. Contracting officials have broad discretion in the selection of the evaluation criteria that will be used in an acquisition. A written acquisition plan generally should include a description of the acquisition’s source selection process and the relationship of the evaluation factors to the acquisition objectives. DOD issued an order with an estimated value of $10.7 million, with a 1-year base period and two 1-year options, for professional support services at the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy at Biggs Army Airfield, El Paso, Texas. Under this order, the contractor was to provide instructors to teach a pre-existing curriculum to Sergeants Major and Master Sergeants in strategic operations, preparing them to take positions throughout the DOD. In so doing, DOD chose not to pay more than $800 million in proposed costs by selecting a lower priced offer over a higher technically rated offer. The March 2016 guide states that the LPTA source selection process may be used in situations where there would not be any value on a product or service exceeding the required technical or performance requirements. The guide also states that such situations may include acquisitions for well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services; where risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal; and where DOD has determined there would be no need or value to pay more for higher performance. Section 813, as amended, requires that DOD revise the DFARS to require that the LPTA process only be used in situations when the following eight criteria are met. Contracting officials determined there was a low risk of contractor failure because the tasks and processes, such as engine maintenance, corrosion prevention, and aircraft washing, are strictly defined by an Air Force instruction. Contracting officials determined there was no value in performing a tradeoff because the tasks were for routine work and all of the IDIQ contract holders previously were found to have the technical capability to perform the work. Contracting officials stated that they generally considered five of the eight criteria in Section 813 when awarding the 14 contracts and orders we reviewed. This was done, in part, because according to contracting officials, those criteria are inherently considered by contracting officials when determining which source selection process should be used. Further, based on our analysis, these five criteria are generally reflected in DOD’s March 2016 Source Selection Procedures. When we raised this issue, a DPC official stated that DOD plans to address whether the LPTA process for the 14 contracts and orders we reviewed. As previously discussed, DOD used the LPTA process an estimated 45 percent of the time for a mix of products and services, including fuel, aircraft parts, computer equipment, construction-related services, engineering support services, and ship maintenance and repairs. We did not make recommendations to DOD in this report. In 2017, we reviewed contracts that DOD awarded using the LPTA process for service categories for which Section 8.",

This guide is a compilation of cost estimates for the military departments’s MILCON appropriations. Specifically, appropriations are available for limited purposes, such as liquidating obligations made during the period of availability or adjusting contract costs. After these 5 years, any remaining unexpended amounts, whether obligated or unobligated, are canceled and returned to the U.S. Treasury. Once funds are returned to the U.S. Treasury, they are no longer available for any purposes. DOD obligates its appropriations throughout the period in which the appropriation is available. An “unobligated balance” is the difference between the total appropriation amount and total obligations made against the appropriated amounts. An “unexpended balance” is the total of obligated but unliquidated and unobligated amounts. According to DOD officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either rescinded by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. However, DOD also stated that it concurred with the intent and general applicability of the twelve steps to military construction and that DOD cost estimating guidance lacks specificity in several of these areas. DOD acknowledged that expanding its cost guidance to more fully incorporate these steps would benefit the military construction program, and that it is planning to address this by revising its cost guidance during Fiscal Year 2019. In our report, we recognize that it may not be appropriate to fully apply all 12 steps to each construction project. For example, it may not be realistic or to the military departments’ benefit to conduct a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis or develop an independent cost estimate for all the construction projects they initiate every year, especially for low-cost projects. Accordingly, we did not recommend that DOD fully apply all 12 steps to each construction project, but rather that it fully incorporate the 12 steps into the Unified Facilities Criteria so that, at least, each step is considered for each project. Additionally, we reviewed DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria and the active component can experience a wide range of differences between initial cost estimates and final costs during the execution of the",

CMS estimated that CMS did not have the information available to estimate how much data was missing because not all laboratories reported or the extent to which the data collected were representative of all of the data that laboratories were required to report. CMS also estimated that Medicare expenditures could increase by $218 million for panel tests, each with its own NPI, then the organization could report data to CMS for multiple applicable laboratories. CMS collected data from laboratories used the billing code associated with the panel test, Medicare paid the bundled payment rate for that billing code. CMS collected data from laboratories used the billing code. CMS estimated that Medicare expenditures for these tests from 2018 through 2020 could reach $13.5 billion, a $10.1 billion increase from the $3.3 billion we estimated Medicare would spend using the bundled payment rates in the CLFS. We estimated that CMS received the share of CLFS expenditures received by the laboratories that reported. Our analysis found that CMS collected data from laboratories that received the majority of CLFS payments to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories in 2016. However, the laboratories that reported private-payer data received less than 70 percent of CLFS expenditures to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories. CMS identified four other types of potentially inaccurate data that it determined would not significantly impact Medicare payment rates. CMS estimated that CMS collected data from laboratories that received 68 percent of 2016 CLFS payments to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories. CMS estimated that Medicare expenditures could increase Medicare expenditures by $218 million from 2018 through 2020 compared to expenditures based on Medicare’s 2016 utilization and allowable amounts. For example, under the 2016 CLFS, Medicare paid approximately 435,000 claims for panel tests that included the laboratory tests assay of creatinine (HCPCS code 82565) and assay of urea nitrogen (HCPCS code 84520) at an average bundled payment rate of $6",

The Bureau has not finalized all of the security controls to be implemented; assessed those controls; developed plans to remediate control weaknesses; and determined whether there is time to fully remediate any deficiencies. In March 2017, the Bureau reported that the CEDCaP program’s cost estimate was increasing by about $400 million—from its original estimate of $548 million in 2013 to a revised estimate of $965 million in May 2017. In June 2017, the Bureau faces significant challenges in managing the schedule for developing and testing systems for the 2018 End-to-End Test. The Bureau still has significant development and testing work that is scheduled to begin in August 2017. In this regard, the Bureau still has significant development and testing work that remains to be completed. The 2018 End-to-End Test also involves collecting PII on hundreds of thousands of households across the country, which further increases the need to properly secure these systems. In July 2017, we reported that the Bureau provides adequate time to perform these security assessments, completes them in a timely manner, and ensures that risks are at an acceptable level before the systems are deployed. In July 2017, we reported that the Bureau had taken steps to ensure that its use of administrative records would lower the cost and improve the accuracy of the 2020 Census. For example, the Bureau set a rule that it would only use administrative records to count a household when a minimum amount of information was present within data sources. According to the Bureau, this would help ensure that administrative records are used only in circumstances where research has shown them to be most accurate. Additionally, since the Bureau did not fully follow best practices for developing and maintaining the life-cycle cost estimate, as previously described, annual budget requests based on that cost estimate may not be fully informed. A high-quality cost estimate is the foundation of a good budget. A major purpose of a cost estimate is to support the budget process by providing an estimate of the funding required to efficiently execute a program. Because most programs do not remain static but evolve over time, developing a cost estimate should not be a onetime event but rather a recurrent process. Effective program and cost control requires ongoing revisions to the cost estimate and budget. In July 2017, we reported that the Bureau had already tested the uses of administrative records that hold the most potential for reducing census costs, such as counting people who did not respond to census mailings. In addition, in September 2017 the Bureau reported that at least two of the systems expected to be used in the Bureau’",
  ". Initiatives Focused on Medicare-Medicaid Beneficiaries. This category includes models focused on better serving individuals eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare in a cost-effective manner. These requirements include: consulting with representatives of relevant federal agencies, as well as clinical and analytical experts in medicine or health care management, and general administrative expenses. This goal has three performance measures that focus on ACOs. As shown in table 3, the Innovation Center has reported mixed results in achieving the targets set. According to agency reported data, the Innovation Center met the targets for 2 of its 3 Goal 1 performance measures for 2015. For the remaining measure—the percentage of ACOs that shared in savings—the center did not meet its target during either of the two years for which data were available. According to officials, when results fall short of targets, the Innovation Center’s efforts to improve the quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid patients and their families, the Innovation Center’s efforts to improve the quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid patients and their families, the Innovation Center’s efforts to improve the quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid patients and their families, the Innovation Center’s efforts to improve the quality of care. According to officials, the 2016 decrease in obligations for model programs was due in part to some of the earlier, expensive models ending and to newer models being less costly than the older models. Officials also identified changes to operational and participant support systems, which have included changes to the timing of participant data reporting, revisions to how data are collected from participants, and changes to the way learning materials are delivered to participants. According to officials, these types of changes are generally intended to help improve the experience of participants. However, as shown in table 3, the Innovation Center set a target for 2016 that was lower than the 2015 target. The center’s obligations for both innovation support and administration increased from around $20 million for each category in fiscal year 2011 to about $163 million for innovation support and $119 million for administration in fiscal year 2016. Officials told us that as obligations for model programs grew, so did obligations for innovation support and administration, which includes indirect costs and contractor assistance. The Innovation Center has used the results from model evaluations to generate ideas for new models. According to Innovation Center officials, the evaluation of each model adequately demonstrated that the delivery and payment approach tested reduced Medicare spending while maintaining or improving quality of care. In addition, the Innovation Center’s evaluation of each model was based on the following criteria. In addition, the Innovation Center has developed new models that build upon the approaches of earlier models, but include adjustments intended to address identified limitations. The two models were: Pioneer ACO. Pioneer ACO tested an ACO delivery and payment approach that gave providers an opportunity to be paid a relatively greater share of savings generated, compared to participants in other ACO models, in exchange for accepting financial responsibility for any losses. In year 3 of the model, ACOs that met certain levels of savings in the first two years could elect to receive a portion of their Medicare fee-for-service payments in the form of predetermined, per beneficiary per month payments. The Innovation Center reported that the third-party contractor collected both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data are used to assess program spending and quality of care and the qualitative data are used to provide the context needed to understand the quantitative results. The Innovation Center noted in its report to Congress that although the results for fiscal year 2016 showed a slight decrease in overall participation in Innovation Center or related learning activities, the majority of models performed higher than their individual targets. Several models underperformed, however, bringing down the overall percentage rate. In addition to the Goal 3 performance measures, the Innovation Center identifies two related contextual indicators—which according to officials are measures that provide supporting information to help understand trends or other information related to the Innovation Center. In September 2017, the Innovation Center provided some insight into its future plans when it issued an informal “request for information” that identified guiding principles under which models will be designed going forward, described focus areas for new models, and requested feedback from stakeholders. According to CMS officials, a model evaluation and a certification for expansion differ in that a model evaluation assesses the historical impact of a delivery and payment approach for model participants only, while a certification for expansion assesses the future impact on program spending across all beneficiaries, payers, and providers who would be affected by the expanded model. Based on its assessments, the Office of the Actuary certified both models for expansion and steps have been taken to expand them. The evaluation of BPCI Model 2 found that orthopedic surgery episodes—of which approximately 90 percent were hip and knee joint replacement surgeries—may have resulted in reduced program spending and improved quality of care. However, the evaluation also identified limitations affecting those results. For example, the target prices for hip and knee replacement surgeries did not account for potential differences in Medicare spending between elective surgeries and surgeries required after a fracture. As a result of this limitation,",
  ". Subsequently, the explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, directed USDS to provide a quarterly status report on, among other things, current USDS projects that are in danger of failing or are not producing results. These meetings involved OMB and agency leadership and were intended to increase accountability and improve performance. These reports provided the requested information they were not issued quarterly. According to the E-Gov staff, OMB was not able to report quarterly on the programs because of other competing reporting requirements. The staff stated that OMB was not able to report quarterly on the programs because of other competing reporting requirements, limited resources available to draft the report, and the amount of time it takes to get its reports fully reviewed. Moreover, the staff stated that they did not address all of the top 10 high priority programs because, as stated earlier in this report, they believe the explanatory statement to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, no longer directed them to continue reporting on the programs. Specifically, the explanatory statement directed USDS to provide a quarterly report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate describing the status of current USDS teams and projects, including the top 10 high priority programs, and as many as four programs being identified for some larger agencies. Further, according to the staff, the Federal CIO approved the process for selecting the high priority programs. In addition, although USDS was directed to report quarterly, it did not do so. Instead, it issued a report in December 2016, nearly a year after Congress’s direction, and in July 2017, nearly 7 months after its first report. In discussing this matter, USDS staff said they were not able to conduct an annual, agency-wide portfolio review to, among other things, reduce the number of federal agencies’ IT spending and demonstrate how their investments aligned with the agency’s mission and business functions. In addition, although OMB was directed to report quarterly on the top 10 high priority programs, OMB did not provide a quarterly report on the top 10 high priority programs. OMB did not provide a quarterly report on the top 10 high priority programs. In 2014 and 2015, OMB’s PortfolioStat guidance also called for it and agencies to identify high impact IT investments that were a part of each program as well as total IT spending, average CIO risk rating, major milestones, and the level of involvement USDS has with the program. Additionally, as we have previously reported, its project selection process is consistent with best practices, which state that organizations should establish and implement procedures for prioritizing projects that include identifying selection criteria to help consistently select projects based on their contributions to the strategic goals of the organization. As shown in the table, OMB made two changes to the top 10 list in 2016. Specifically, it replaced the Social Security Administration’s Service Modernization program with the agency’s Disability Case Processing System due to a change in focus within the agency. In addition, OMB’s December 2016 and July 2017 reports on USDS’s projects did not address the top 10 high priority programs across the government. However, continued reporting on the top 10 high priority programs would further enhance congressional oversight by providing congressional stakeholders with information that is not readily available on those programs. We recently issued an update to our high-risk report and determined that, while progress has been made in addressing the high- risk area of IT acquisitions and operations, significant work remains to be completed. As noted in our report, OMB provides additional oversight to high impact IT programs by regularly communicating about them through quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily meetings with agency CIOs and program staff, depending on the risk and profile of the program. In contrast, communication is much less frequent for other major IT systems. The staff added they also discuss high impact programs with agencies during quarterly PortfolioStat meetings. Further, they stated that USDS, an OMB component, was to provide a quarterly status report on its current projects, including the top 10 high priority programs. The current mission of USDS is to deliver better government services to the American people through technology and design. According to OMB, this oversight responsibility covers about 800 major and nearly 5,700 non-major IT investments across the federal government. As a part of the oversight, the E-Gov office develops policy and reviews federal agencies’ IT strategic plans. In addition, OMB establishes processes to analyze, track, and evaluate the risks and results of IT investments made by executive agencies, and issues guidance on processes for selecting and overseeing agency privacy and security protections for information and information systems. OMB has also implemented a series of initiatives to improve the oversight of underperforming investments and more effectively manage IT. These initiatives include the following: Federal IT Dashboard. In June 2009, to further improve the transparency into and oversight of federal agencies’ IT investments, OMB deployed the Federal IT Dashboard, a public website with information on the performance of these investments. In doing so, the Director should ensure",

DOE provided $1.12 billion in funding to nine large projects aimed at demonstrating the commercial viability of CCS technologies. DOE provided $1.54 billion (about 91 percent) of the $1.54 billion in funding DOE provided for the projects. The remaining projects and funding supported R&D projects for both coal and oil and gas technologies, mostly to universities and industry, located in 46 states and the District of Columbia. For nine large demonstration projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017, DOE provided $1.12 billion in funding. These projects received that funding from appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) and supported efforts to reduce the financial and technical risks of commercial CCS, according to a 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service. DOE provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Energy, and other interested parties. As we have previously reported, CCS is a key technology that shows potential for increased heat-to- electricity conversion efficiencies, high power density, and simplicity of operation compared to existing steam-based power cycles. $5,000 for a research conference to $29 million for the University of Texas at Austin’s active project on the deep-water characterization and scientific assessment of gas hydrates. Specifically, DOE identified the following four categories as oil and gas-related research areas: Gas Hydrates: The development of technologies to find, characterize, and recover methane from gas hydrates through field testing, numerical simulation, and laboratory experimentation, among other things. For example, DOE provided the University of California-San Diego $350,000 in funding for a 3-year active project to characterize the baselines and changes in gas hydrate systems. We used fiscal year 2006 as the start date because it was the first year that DOE issued an advanced fossil energy project solicitation—an announcement of opportunities for loan guarantees for advanced fossil energy projects—and we used August 2018 as the end date in order to provide the most up-to-date information as possible. We also reviewed DOE’s funding for advanced fossil energy projects. To address the first objective, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DOE guidance. We analyzed DOE advanced fossil energy R&D projects. We analyzed DOE advanced fossil energy R&D project data for fiscal years 2010 through 2017. We focused our review on advanced fossil energy R&D projects that received funding through the Office of Fossil Energy’s (FE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) because the 794 projects represent all of the advanced fossil energy R&D projects in our scope started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. We used fiscal year 2010 as the start date because DOE officials told us that DOE’s current data management system came into use for the R&D projects that started in fiscal year 2010. DOE provided $141 million in funding for the project from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. DOE’s involvement with the project is scheduled to conclude in September 2019, according to DOE documentation. During calendar year 2017, the project captured and stored over 500,000 metric tons of CO emitted from two large steam-methane reformers, which produce hydrogen from methane, for its demonstration project in Texas. The captured gas is compressed and sent via pipeline to oil fields in eastern Texas to be used for its demonstration.",

According to NASA procurement officials at headquarters and at two NASA centers, it is at the discretion of the NASA Centers’ offices of procurement and contracting officers to decide if a clause is inserted into modifications, and whether they are considered major. Under this system, contracting officers used templates that included a list of all potential or applicable NFS and FAR clauses, which are incorporated through a manual process. Officials said that if a clause were included in the templates, it is unlikely that it would be removed because doing so would require supervisory approval. NASA procurement officials told us that the agency launched a new contract writing system in June 2017. They said that under the new contract writing system, contracting officers use a logic system that prepopulates each contract with required clauses. They said that the new automated system will likely lead to fewer human errors because inserting the clause will not be a manual process. We asked for contracts awarded in fiscal year 2016 to ensure we were sampling contracts that are required to have the clause and would be reasonably accessible by NASA. We excluded interagency contracts and task or delivery orders awarded using blanket purchase agreements to ensure we sampled base contracts awarded by NASA, not other agencies. We estimated the percentage of NASA contracts expected to include whistleblower clause(s) as the weighted average of results from the administrator’s order. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees and members. For 3 of the 6 complaints, the OIG found that reprisal had occurred and reported those findings to the administrator for final determination of reprisal. The Administrator determined that none of these 3 complaints qualified for protection under the law. For 2 of these complaints, the Administrator found that they did not qualify for protections because they fell under the 2008 version of the statute and failed to allege a violation specific to public health and safety. In 2017, a court affirmed the Administrator’s position. For the third complaint, the Administrator determined reprisal could not be substantiated due to",
  "orated rate thereafter. The wardrobe, lease penalty, and miscellaneous expense types are the same for the home service transfer as for the foreign service transfer. The separate maintenance allowance (SMA) defrays the additional expense of maintaining family members at another location. The separate maintenance allowance (SMA) defrays the additional expense of maintaining family members at another location (1) because of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at the overseas post of assignment, (2) for the convenience of the U.S. government, or (3) because of special needs or hardships involving the employee or a family member. The temporary quarters subsistence allowance assists with the reasonable cost of temporary lodging, meals, and laundry in a foreign area when an employee first arrives at a new post and permanent quarters are not yet available, or when an employee is getting ready to depart the overseas post permanently and must vacate residential quarters. The rate is based on the per diem at post, the size of an employee’s family, and the amount of time the employee receives the allowance. Employees cannot receive this allowance while receiving the allowance. The extraordinary quarters allowance is typically granted for up to 90 days to employees and eligible family members at an overseas post when they are required to partially or completely vacate their permanent quarters because of renovations, repairs, or unhealthy or dangerous conditions in their permanent quarters. The rate is based on the per diem at post, the size of an employee’s family, and the amount of time the employee is required to vacate their permanent quarters. The rate is based on the per diem at post, the size of an employee’s family, and the amount of time the employee is required to vacate their permanent quarters. The rate is based on the per diem at post, post allowance, and family size. In contrast to the temporary quarters subsistence allowance, employees can continue to receive the post allowance when they receive the extraordinary quarters allowance. State offers two additional allowances designed to reimburse employees who must maintain an official residence or employees who incur expenses representing the U.S. government in an official capacity to a foreign government. The official residence expense reimburses a principal representative, such as an ambassador, at an overseas post for expenses related to operating and maintaining a suitable official residence in-country. The official residence expense spending at posts decreased by $2.6 million from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. The representation allowance increased by $6.6 million during the same period (see fig. 9). State’s Office of Overseas Schools determines the adequacy of schools at posts. State determines the approved rate based on allowable education expenses for (1) a school at the post, (2) a school away from the post, (3) home schooling / private instruction, or (4) special-needs education. For the post allowance, spending by country reflects allowance rates, the number of State employees, and the size of State employees’ families at each of the country’s posts. Spending for SMA, by country, depends upon the number of State employees maintaining their families away from post. Spending for hardship pay and danger pay, by country, reflects the allowance rate and number of State employees permanently assigned to posts. The educational travel allowance annually covers the travel expenses of one round trip for each dependent between a school attended and the overseas post of assignment. This benefit is primarily intended to reunite a full-time, postsecondary student attending college (including the postbaccalaureate level), or technical or vocational school with the employee / parent serving the U.S. government in a foreign area. This allowance includes four expense types— predeparture subsistence, wardrobe, lease penalty, and miscellaneous. The predeparture subsistence expense portion assists employees for service at posts where conditions may be difficult or dangerous. State uses the following three allowances to recruit and retain staff at posts: Hardship pay compensates employees for service in foreign areas where conditions of environment differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States in that the living conditions are extraordinarily difficult, involve excessive physical hardship, or are notably unhealthy. Employees assigned to designated posts can earn hardship pay at rates ranging from 5 to 35 percent above basic compensation in 5 percent increments, based on the severity of the hardship as determined by State. Danger pay compensates employees for service in foreign areas where conditions of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. Employees in designated danger pay locations are granted between 15 and 35 percent above basic compensation, in 10 percent increments, based on whether family members are allowed at overseas posts.",

The following is a summary of our analysis of data from our September 2018 report. The following is a summary of our analysis of data from our September 2018 report. In our September 2018 report, we identified 122 discretionary grants and cooperative agreements (grant programs) offered by DOJ and HHS from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that could help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS made approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards through the 122 programs over the period, of which the agencies awarded about $207.7 million to tribal governments or Native American organizations. A list of the 122 programs, which focus on a range of issues such as violence or trauma, justice system reform, alcohol and substance abuse, and reentry and recidivism, can be found in our September 2018 report. The 122 DOJ and HHS grant programs we identified included 27 programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary and 95 programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. In contrast, our analysis also showed a number of differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system. For example, our analysis showed variation in the types of offenses committed by each group. From fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the majority of Native American youth in the federal justice system were arrested, adjudicated, or confined for offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses being assault and sex offenses. In contrast, the majority of involvement of non-Native American youth in the federal system during the same period was due to public order or drug and alcohol offenses at all three stages, with the top two specific offenses being drug and immigration related. Our September 2018 report contains additional information on the differences between Native American and non-Native American youth involved with the federal justice system. For example, we found that the majority (about 75 percent) of Native American youth in the federal justice system were arrested, adjudicated, or confined for offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses being drug and alcohol related. The majority (about 75 percent) of Native American youth in the federal justice system were arrested, adjudicated, or confined for offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses being drug and immigration related. The majority (about 75 percent) of Native American youth in the federal justice system were arrested, adjudicated, or confined for offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses against a person, and the top two specific offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses against a person, and the top two specific offenses against a person, respectively. In 2016, the largest number of arrests by state and local LEAs occurred in Arizona and South Dakota. In contrast, we found that representation of Native American youth arrested, referred for adjudication, and confined at the federal level during the period reviewed was greater (13 to 19 percent) than their representation in the nationwide youth population (1.6 percent). DOJ officials told us that the population of Native Americans in the federal justice system has historically been higher than their share in the nationwide population, and they attributed this and other differences shown by our analysis to federal government jurisdiction over certain crimes in Indian country, as well as the absence of general federal government jurisdiction over non-Native American youth. According to DOJ officials, this jurisdiction requires the federal government to prosecute offenses that would commonly be prosecuted by states if committed outside of Indian country. According to DOJ officials, a small handful of federal criminal statutes apply to all juveniles, such as immigration and drug statutes, but the federal government has been granted greater jurisdiction over Native American youth than non-Native American youth by federal laws that apply to crimes committed in Indian Country, such as the Major Crimes Act. For example, one DOJ official noted that the Major Crimes Act gives the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over crimes such as burglary and sex offenses committed in Indian country. This differs from the treatment of non-Native American youth, who are not prosecuted in the federal system for the same types of offenses, because the federal government does not have jurisdiction over those youth in the federal justice system for the same types of offenses, because the federal government does not have jurisdiction over those youth in the federal justice system. We also found that the United States",
  ", and officials at all six medical centers confirmed that they rely on the Environment of Care inspections database and in a separate system used to track work orders. For example, officials in one medical center noted that the frequency and thoroughness of these inspections has helped them determine day-to-day wear and tear issues and informed their planning processes. Medical center staff noted that condition deficiencies identified through this process are often minor but are nonetheless important to maintenance of a clean and safe patient environment. For example, VA questioned how we characterized the Environment of Care Program in the context of Facility Condition Assessments, the age of its buildings, and software interoperability, and stated that responsibility for a successful Environment of Care Program lies at the medical center. We agree it is important to have a strong Environment of Care Program that is facilitated by leadership at the medical center and VISN-levels. However, even with strong leadership and a robust Environment of Care Program, underlying facility condition issues—impacted by the age of the facility, and other issues that can affect the quality of the facility’s operations and maintenance, VHA’s Department of Health and Human Services (VAHHS) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VAHHS) have not been able to address these issues. VHA’s Department of Health and Human Services has not been able to address these issues. VHA’s Department of Health and Human Services has not been able to address these issues. VHA’s Department of Health and Human Services has not been able to address these issues. VHA’s Department of Health and Human Services has not been able to address these issues.

VHA’s Department of Health and Human Services has not been able to address the deficiencies that have not yet been remediated. For example, the two performance measures on staff attendance at inspections do not directly relate to the condition of the facility but reflect the level of compliance with inspection requirements. This inspection focuses on major systems, while environment of care inspections focus on day-to-day facility conditions, including that of patient-care areas. Additionally, we have previously reported that VA is collaborating with the Office of Personnel Management to address challenges with recruiting and retaining engineering positions. Officials at medical centers included in our review discussed the difficulty of recruiting and retaining employees to perform an inspection and determine facility deficiencies, given that relevant engineering staff was present. Furthermore, we have previously reported that VHA needs to strengthen aspects of the environment of care inspection process to ensure more complete and accurate data on medical center compliance with environment of care standards, and provide better oversight of the system. VHA has not defined program goals and objectives and related performance measures, and is therefore limited in its ability to determine how well program activities, including the environment of care inspection process, are supporting the agency’s broader policy of providing a clean, safe, and functional environment. VHA’s current performance measures are not tied to specific performance goals for the Environment of Care Program, as such goals have not yet been created. A VA- commissioned report noted that there were significant barriers that facility management staff faced in maintaining facilities to a high quality. According to the report, while some of these barriers involved immediate resource constraints such as budgets for staffing and conducting maintenance and janitorial tasks, the root cause of many of these issues is the general age and underlying condition of VHA facilities. Engineering officials at medical centers told us that the amount of work associated with conducting weekly inspections and addressing environment of care deficiencies is substantial. Each medical center should have an environment of care committee, and the medical center director or a designee should facilitate committee meetings to discuss the environment of care processes, findings, trends, and any other related issues. Inspections are conducted by an environment of care inspection team, which is made up of representatives from various facility departments, including, among others: Environmental Management Service—which is responsible for ensuring a state of physical and biological cleanliness, along with performance measures to assess whether the goals and objectives are being achieved, but it has not yet done so. The VHA directive from 2016 that created the Environment of Care Program directed program officials to establish a steering committee, whose responsibilities would include, among other things, developing goals, objectives, and related performance measures for the program. According to a VHA official, VHA formed this committee in January 2018, following delays caused by leadership vacancies and competing demands within the agency. In June 2018, the committee finalized its charter, which states that the scope of the committee’s activities is to include defining goals, objectives, performance metrics, and targets for the Environment of Care Program.

IRS also did not establish threshold values for MSSS risk. IRS subsequently completed the development work for ACA in September 2017, at which point the investment transitioned to operations and maintenance. This omission is concerning given the risk exposure from the agency’s continued use of the legacy assembly language code. In addition, IRS’s risk analysis for IMF included criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk. However, the agency risks not having the information it needs to determine whether the investments fully meet intended objectives, or if there are alternative or more efficient ways to do so. In addition, IRS’s performance metrics generally focused on system availability and usage and did not address the extent to which the operations and maintenance phase continue to meet agency needs. According to the agency, its current systems provide limited visibility into case management practices between programs, process redundancies, and multiple handoffs that can lead to, among other things, increased risks",
  "ees, including reviewing its monitoring protocols and ensuring all grantees were monitored over a 2- year period. ORR’s policy required grantees to attempt to contact the sponsor and child at least three times. In August 2017, ORR told us that the agency had created new guidance on case reporting, records management, retention, and information- sharing requirements for post-release service provider, and that it had collected data on Safety and Well Being follow-up calls that had been made to children and their sponsors. For example, ORR told us that during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, its grantees reached 87 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of unaccompanied children were referred for a mandatory home study. In our 2016 report, we found that between January 7, 2014, and April 17, 2015, nearly 52,000 children from El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras were released to sponsors. In addition, we identified several cases in which forms that were present in the files were not signed or dated. We found that although ORR used its web-based data system to track some information about the services children received, and grantees reported on the services they provided in their annual reports, the documents contained in case files were the primary source of information about the services provided to individual children. We concluded that without including all of the documents in case files, it was difficult for ORR to verify that required services were actually provided in accordance with ORR policy and cooperative agreements. In our 2016 report, we noted that ORR’s most comprehensive monitoring of grantees occurred during on-site visits, but that onsite visits to facilities were inconsistent. Prior to fiscal year 2014, ORR was required to collect information from potential sponsors and run various background checks. In 2016, ORR was required to collect information from potential sponsors and run various background checks.

ORR did not meet its goal to visit all of its facilities by the end of fiscal year 2015, citing lack of resources. In our 2016 report, we concluded that without consistently monitoring its grantees, ORR cannot know whether they were complying with their agreements and that children were receiving needed services. We recommended that the Secretary of HHS direct ORR to review its monitoring program to ensure that onsite visits are conducted in a timely manner, case files are systematically reviewed as part of or separate from onsite visits, and that grantees properly document the services they provide to children. HHS concurred with this recommendation and stated that it had created a new monitoring initiative workgroup to examine opportunities for further improvement. In 2015, we reported that the interagency process to refer unaccompanied children from DHS to ORR shelters was inefficient and vulnerable to error. For example, as of April 2015, ORR issued a summary of its fiscal year 2016 monitoring showing that monitoring of all of its 88 grantees was completed over the 2-year period of fiscal years 2015 and 2016. As a result of this monitoring, the agency reported issuing 786 corrective actions, almost all of which were closed within 90 days. The most common corrective actions were related to incomplete case file documentation and inconsistent implementation of some of ORR policies and procedures, according to ORR. Subsequently, for the 2-year period of fiscal years 2017 and 2018, ORR reported that as of April 2018, it had completed monitoring of 65 grantees and planned to complete monitoring of all of its remaining 39 grantees by the end of the fiscal year. In addition, we noted that the inefficiencies in the placement process for unaccompanied children had been a long-standing challenge for DHS and ORR. Therefore, we recommended that DHS and HHS jointly develop and implement a documented interagency process with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, as well as procedures to disseminate placement decisions, for all agencies involved in referring and placing unaccompanied children in ORR shelters. The agencies agreed with this recommendation and in response, DHS and HHS finalized a memorandum of agreement (MOA) in February 2016. In April 2018, HHS reported that ORR was in the process of reviewing and revising its monitoring. In",
