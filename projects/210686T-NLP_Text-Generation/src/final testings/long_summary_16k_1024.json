  "U production would be needed. NNSA and TVA officials noted that other fuel cycle facilities have previously been uninterested in conducting book storage for NNSA, so options may be limited. According to NNSA officials, if book storage was unavailable in the future, NNSA could pay for the physical storage of the LEU. However, this option was not ultimately included in NNSA’s October 2016 mission need statement. This option was not ultimately included in NNSA’s October 2016 mission need statement. Further, the preliminary cost estimates developed by NNSA for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge technology options were limited in scope. The preliminary cost estimates developed by NNSA for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge technology options were limited in scope—sized for a capacity to enrich uranium only for tritium production—and do not reflect the full costs of building a uranium enrichment facility that could eventually meet a range of enriched uranium mission needs. Prior to the use of TVA’s reactor, the United States used other government-owned reactors to produce tritium (see fig. 1). In 1999, TVA signed an interagency agreement with DOE to produce tritium at its Watts Bar and Sequoyah commercial nuclear reactors. Due to degradation of the equipment, the expected rate of equipment failure, a lack of replacement parts, the dispersion of trained and qualified personnel, and ongoing decontamination and demolition activities, a major effort would be required to support tritium production for a number of years. Since 2015, the plant and equipment have significantly deteriorated, and restart of the Paducah GDP is no longer a feasible option, according to NNSA documents and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) representatives. Due to degradation of the equipment, the expected rate of equipment failure, a lack of replacement parts, the dispersion of trained and qualified personnel, and ongoing decontamination and demolition activities, a major effort would be required to support tritium production for a number of years, according to NNSA’s technical evaluation and the 2015 plan.

NNSA’s preliminary estimates for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge are limited in scope, and the estimate for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge are limited in scope, according to NNSA officials and ORNL representatives. NNSA officials also stated that there will be challenges in establishing a U.S. manufacturing base of suppliers for the small The following is a summary of our assessments. Comprehensive. Best practices state that—to be considered comprehensive—a cost estimate should include both government and contractor costs of the project over its full life cycle, from “cradle to grave.” This includes costs from the inception of the project through design, development, deployment, and operation and maintenance, to retirement of the project. According to NNSA and State Department officials, longstanding U.S. policy will likely preclude the use of these options. The mission need statement indicates a preference for using enriched uranium to continue the tritium production mission, as it only identifies options to obtain additional enriched uranium. The mission need statement indicates a preference for using enriched uranium to continue the tritium production mission, as it only identifies options to obtain additional enriched uranium. This approach would exclude consideration of certain technology options, such as one that may have the potential to produce tritium without the need for enriched uranium. According to a senior DOE official, though DOE has discontinued the majority of its funding, the department has taken two actions to preserve the large centrifuge technology—preserving the intellectual property for this technology and hiring some former Centrus employees—to ensure that the technology can be deployed if it is selected in the analysis of alternatives. Further, under NNSA’s timeline for a domestic uranium enrichment capability, it could take until 2027 to begin construction of a uranium enrichment plant. We found that the cost estimate to build a large centrifuge facility partially met the comprehensive characteristic because it included a high-level description of the work to be performed, and presented a brief summary description of the schedule, number of machines, and activities. However, the estimate was not a life cycle cost estimate because it excluded certain costs, and",
  "-lowering modification, and, according to FHA officials, some modifications could increase monthly payments for borrowers with a large number of missed payments. Likewise, borrowers could lose access to benefits such as reevaluation for the suite of FHA loss mitigation options. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications offered by purchasers. FHA may not be required to sell loan assets if a serious conflict exists between selling loans and policy goals. FHA officials told us that it also has absolute discretion to exclude one or more loans from the sale. According to FHA officials told us that FHA has two different provisions in place to correct when a loan should not have been sold. While we considered classifying loans reported as resold as performing, our review of status sequences for loans with at least one resold status showed that purchasers reported a range of nonperforming outcomes before and after the resold status. Additionally, about 22 percent of the modifications offered to borrowers whose loans were sold in the 2015 sale and later included a deferment. These rates generally exceeded the foreclosure and short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure estimates for similar, unsold loans (34 and about 9 percent, respectively). Purchasers told us that the outcome they pursue for a loan depends in part on the borrower’s preference. If the highest bid was at least $5,054,000, the MMI Fund may not be negatively affected by the sale. The piecewise model estimated that the best option is to try to modify the loan and achieve reperformance status. These rates generally exceeded the foreclosure and short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure estimates for similar, unsold loans. This generally results in a greater loss to the MMI Fund. In the case of a DASP sale, FHA pays a claim to the servicer in the amount of the unpaid mortgage balance and other expenses. In addition, for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure, our calculated reserve price was 25 percent or more below the winning bid. When FHA described its process for evaluating program changes, FHA also described the use and reliability of these data sets in the sections that follow this table. We attempted to minimize differences between the sold and unsold loans by matching loans across several variables that could affect the likelihood of foreclosure or foreclosure. In the case of a DASP sale, FHA avoids interest and servicing costs during the foreclosure period as well as REO-related expenses, but incurs the cost of the difference between the unpaid balance and other expenses. FHA also experienced another period when no sales were conducted between 2005 and 2009. Federal internal control standards require that management implement control activities through policies. This includes documenting in policies the internal control responsibilities of the organization and periodically reviewing policies, procedures, When HUD extended the prohibition against foreclosure from 6 months to 12 months in 2015, for instance, a HUD press release stated that such changes “not only strengthen the program but help to ensure it continues to serve its intended purposes of supporting the MMI Fund and offering borrowers a second chance at avoiding foreclosure.” And when HUD changed DASP in 2016 to prohibit purchasers from abandoning low- value loans prior to being modified to their monthly payments after being modified. We did not independently verify the data in the FHFA reports, but we interviewed the FHFA staff that generated the report about the reliability of the data. Some limitations stem from the differences between FHA’s and the enterprises’ pools and the underlying loans. FHA has additional regulatory requirements, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales. We limited our review of participants and characteristics to the loans included in our comparison analysis of outcomes to provide descriptive context for this analysis. To assess the reliability of the data sources above, we reviewed all loans sold in DASP sales that occurred between 2013 and 2016, with some exceptions, in line with the scope of our comparison analysis of outcomes. We selected this scope because it represented the period for which FHA was generally able to provide consistent postsale quarterly reports. We found that less than 0.1 percent of the sold loans in our scope were not reported as delinquent by servicers and determined that, due to their small percentage, excluding these loans would not bias our results. In addition, FHA may not collect the data it needs to evaluate whether modifications offered by purchasers remain sustainable. Nonetheless, FHA received similar numbers of bids and bid amounts relative to the estimated property values as the enterprises. However, the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of the",

Absent applications or verified losses, Puerto Rico assumed that nonapplicants and applicants without verified losses had some level of unmet needs. Puerto Rico estimated these potential unmet needs to be approximately $5.8 billion. To estimate unmet needs, HUD then multiplied the number of units it identified as having major-low, major-high, and severe damage to account for owners and renters that did not apply to FEMA and FEMA applicants without verified losses. HUD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We considered three comments to be more than technical in nature. HUD concurred with our recommendation and has since updated its policies and procedures to require that nonapplicants and applicants without verified losses. Puerto Rico estimated these potential unmet needs to be approximately $5.8 billion. HUD officials told us that there were a significant number of FEMA applicants who were denied in Puerto Rico due to an inability to prove property ownership. However, the draft report identified grantee capacity as an administrative challenge that CDBG-DR grantees face that is not related to the lack of permanent statutory authority. The HUD OIG also has conducted numerous audits of the internal controls of prior CDBG-DR funds. This is because HUD’s estimate of unmet needs was used to allocate funds to grantees and grantees’ estimates were used to target their funding. HUD also noted that there was more than one way to determine unmet needs and that it was acceptable for grantees to use different methodologies to reflect their local circumstances. According to HUD officials, all four grantees had entered into grant agreements with HUD for their initial 2017 CDBG-DR funds. As of January 2019, all four grantees had entered into grant agreements with HUD for their initial 2017 CDBG-DR funds. In written feedback that HUD provided to the grantee on its capacity assessment, the HUD reviewer asked for more comprehensive analysis of staffing needs and to include a rationale for the number of staff to be assigned to each function. Yet, other feedback HUD provided focused on whether certain information was included rather than on the quality of the information. For example, when reviewing the grantee’s financial processes and procedures, the reviewer pointed out that the grantee had not shown that it had addressed prior audit findings. In another instance, the reviewer asked the grantee to include additional information in the section of its action plan on unmet needs, but did not focus on the grantee’s methodology. According to a HUD official, this documentation was not readily available for each grantee because it is not part of the official administrative record. Even if readily available, such documentation likely would not substantiate HUD’s conclusions that grantees’ submissions and estimates were sufficient. CPD’s monitoring handbook states that staff must document the basis for their conclusions during a monitoring review because “monitoring conclusions must be clear to persons unfamiliar with the participant, program, or technical area.” According to a HUD official, this documentation was not readily available for each grantee because it is not part of the official administrative record.

After 1999, CSPF’s investment policy under other, successive named fiduciaries continued to be broad and generally specified that the plan should invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities. Specifically J.P. Morgan’s and Northern Trust’s consecutive investment policies for part of the plan’s assets continued to specify that a majority of the plan’s assets be invested in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 15 percent be invested in nonpublicly traded assets. CSPF’s investment policy under other, successive named fiduciaries continued to be broad and generally specified that the plan should invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 15 percent be invested in nonpublicly traded assets.

CSPF trustees said that named fiduciaries considered investing in alternative assets, but instead chose to increase the plan’s allocation to equity assets. We also ran another calculation that did not include “other” income so we could estimate the impact of not adjusting for such information. The U.S. Department of the Treasury provided no comments. We will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and other interested parties. This report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. In 2015, the plan’s actuary certified that the plan was in “critical and declining” status. Multiemployer plan trust funds can be allocated among many different types of assets, any of which can generally be passively- or actively-managed, domestically or internationally based, or publicly or nonpublicly traded (see table 1). A plan’s funded percentage is its ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities. We calculated the dollar-weighted average return, calculated as a geometric average of the annual returns over the period. The dollar-weighted average return is the rate that, when applied over time to a variety of economic and demographic factors, including the potential volatility of asset values, estimates of a plan’s funded percentage may vary from year to year. Defined benefit pension plans Treasury, specifically the IRS, is charged with determining whether a private sector pension plan qualifies for preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the IRS is generally responsible for enforcing ERISA’s minimum funding requirements, among other things. The consent decree defines roles and responsibilities for its parties, including the court, the court-appointed independent special counsel, DOL, the plan and its Board of Trustees, and the independent asset manager, which is called the named fiduciary. The primary role of the court is to oversee and enforce the consent decree. Specifically, to ensure we captured the vast majority of the assets in CSPF and the plan’s demographics—such as an older population and fewer employers—in its decision to withdraw. CSPF officials said they did not want UPS to withdraw because its annual contributions accounted for about one-third of all contributions to the plan. CSPF officials also told us that, prior to the UPS withdrawal, they had expected the population of active UPS workers in CSPF to grow over time. In our prior work, we reported that multiemployer plans generally develop an assumed average rate of investment return and use that assumption to determine funding targets, required contributions, and the potential cost of benefit improvements. We did not identify an alternative asset category in CSPF’s asset reports for 2016, but the TUCS comparator group median asset allocation in that year is 11.8 percent of assets. Similar to our findings when comparing the returns on CSPF’s investments to a customized peer group of other large institutional funds, the annual returns on CSPF’s investments in recent decades have also generally been in line with the annual returns of similar multiemployer pension plans.

  " level for the LCR. EPA has efforts underway to reconsider the action level for the LCR. EPA has efforts underway to reconsider the action level for the LCR, which may include a change in the action level from one that is based on technical feasibility, to one that also considers lead exposure in vulnerable populations such as infants and young children, which EPA refers to as a health-based benchmark. In 1988, the SDWA was amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA), which banned the manufacture and sale of drinking water coolers with lead-lined tanks containing more than 8 percent lead; the statute defined a drinking water cooler as containing 8 percent lead or less as “lead-free.” The LCCA also required states to establish testing and remediation programs for schools. The LCCA also required states to establish testing and remediation programs for schools. However, in 1996 a federal circuit court held that this requirement was unconstitutional. In 2011, Congress passed the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, which amended the SDWA by lowering the maximum allowable lead content in “lead-free” plumbing materials such as pipes. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead in school drinking water. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program to support school district efforts to test for and remediation of lead in school drinking water. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead contamination in drinking water at schools. We interviewed representatives with the University of Massachusetts, because of their role in implementing the state’s program to support school district efforts to test for and remediate lead in school drinking water. As a condition of receiving funds, school districts are required to test for lead using standards that are at least as stringent as those in federal guidance for schools. In March 2018, Congress appropriated $20 million to EPA for this grant program. Lead can enter drinking water when service lines or plumbing fixtures that contain lead corrode, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content. According to EPA, responsibility for water management may be held by individuals in different positions, such as facilities managers or environmental specialists. Lead is a neurotoxin that can accumulate in the body over time with long- lasting effects, particularly for children. According to the CDC, lead in school drinking water during the past 12 months varied substantially, depending on the number of schools in which a district took action to remediate lead (see table 3). The median expenditure for school districts taking action in one to four schools was $4,000 compared to a median expenditure for school districts taking action in 51 or more schools of $278,000. EPA regional officials provided examples of eight states that have requirements for schools to test for lead in school drinking water as EPA has made further efforts to communicate the importance of lead testing to schools to help ensure that their lead testing programs are in line with good practices included in the 3Ts guidance. EPA has made further efforts to communicate the importance of lead testing to schools to help ensure that their lead testing programs are in line with good practices included in the 3Ts guidance. We also evaluated federal efforts against the Memorandum of Understanding, in which EPA, Education, and CDC agreed to encourage testing drinking water for lead and communicate with key stakeholders, among other things. To inform all of our research objectives, we interviewed representatives with the National Conference of State Legislatures, National Center for Healthy Housing, National Alliance of Public Charter Schools, the DC Public Charter School Board, and the 21st Century School Fund. We identified a range of approaches to communicating testing efforts in the 17 school districts we interviewed. Some school districts reported issuing press releases, putting letters in multiple languages in students’ backpacks, sending emails to parents, holding public meetings, and releasing information through social media. Although the guidance recommends that school districts prioritize taking action if lead levels from water fountains and other outlets used for consumption exceed 20 ppb (based on a 250 milliliter water sample), EPA officials told us when the guidance was originally developed in response to the 1988 LCCA requirement, the agency did not have information available to recommend an action level specifically designed for schools. Furthermore, EPA officials told us that the action level in the 3Ts guidance is not a health-based standard. However, there are statements in the guidance that appear to suggest otherwise. For a more detailed discussion of our survey methodology, see appendix I. The survey was comprised of closed- and open-ended questions. In this appendix, we",
  ", that the Select Agent Program did not consistently report violations of the Select Agent Program’s policies and procedures. The Select Agent Program did not consistently refer laboratories to investigative entities for violations of the select agent regulations or enforce regulations related to incidents involving incomplete inactivation. According to agency reports and inspectors we spoke with, inspectors often travel 30 percent to 50 percent or more of their time in performing their duties. This intensive workload and travel schedule has led to delays in both the issuing of inspection reports and processing of registration amendments. According to a 2017 CDC report, the CDC and APHIS components of the Select Agent Program manage fragmentation by collaborating on many aspects of the program, such as through maintaining frequent communication at the director level. They also said that the program had not developed a joint mission statement or strategic planning tools in the past because they prioritized other efforts in the past because they prioritized other efforts in recent years, including responding to incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2015, addressing recommendations from recent reports, and developing a new database for the Select Agent Program.

The Select Agent Program does not fully meet our key elements of effective oversight. Specifically, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program does not have joint strategic planning documents to guide its oversight efforts, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan; it did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan and workforce plan; it did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan over the course of our review.

Specifically, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program regularly performs reviews of laboratories’ compliance with regulatory and program requirements, but these reviews may not target the activities that pose the highest risk to biological safety and security. Most laboratories registered with the Select Agent Program are registered with CDC (238 of 276). (See fig. 1 for information about the laboratories registered with the program.) In fiscal year 2016, CDC’s budget to manage its component of the Select Agent Program was about $21 million and APHIS’s was about $5.5 million. Select agent regulations govern the possession, use, and transfer of designated select agents. To apply for a certificate of registration, the laboratory is required to report violations of the Select Agent Program’s policies and procedures. CDC and APHIS also held a workshop for responsible officials from registered laboratories in December 2016 to disseminate program information; the workshop also provided the opportunity for attendees to interact. Many laboratory representatives told us that this was very helpful, and some noted that they had not had an opportunity to communicate and share lessons learned with responsible officials from other registered laboratories in the past. Some other regulatory sectors in the United States are also structurally independent from regulated laboratories as a mechanism to ensure independence. For example, prior to the creation of NRC in 1974, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was responsible for both promotion and oversight of the nuclear industry. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 established NRC as a separate, independent entity. According to a relevant Senate committee report, this was a response to growing criticism that there was a basic conflict between the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission’s regulation of the nuclear power industry and its development and promotion of new technology for the industry. In addition, once initial risks are identified, it is important for agencies to regularly re-examine risks to identify new risks or changes to existing risks. In addition, federal internal control standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. According to CDC’s Circular A-123 requires federal agencies to integrate risk management activities into their program management to help ensure they are effectively managing risks that could affect the achievement of agency objectives. According to the circular, once initial risks are identified, it is important for agencies to regularly re-examine risks to identify new risks or changes to existing risks. In addition, federal internal control standards state that management should explore options to improve independence, including reexamining previous reviews and assessing the need to address gaps in the",

Key federal entities, including Interior and CEQ, have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the San Francisco Bay Delta watershed. Different combinations of federal and nonfederal entities have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the Bay Delta watershed. Different combinations of federal and nonfederal entities work throughout the watershed and its three major geographic areas, which are the San Francisco Bay and its local watershed (Bay), the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), and the upper watershed, which includes California’s Central Valley and the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. See below for a list of federal and nonfederal entities and a brief description of some of their restoration-related roles in the Bay Delta watershed. In the state level, the San Francisco Estuary Institute and the Delta Stewardship Council each maintains a database with information about federal and nonfederal restoration efforts. These plans include goals similar to those outlined in the CCMP or the Delta Plan—such as ecosystem restoration, climate resilience, and other facilities. Several federal agencies have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the Bay-Delta watershed. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities carry out a wide range of restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities carry out a wide range of restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities provide input on developing and revising the CCMP and have integrated goals into the CCMP from their own topic- or entity-specific strategic plans. In addition, since California stopped participating in the originally structured CALFED partnership, funding for ecosystem restoration in the Bay area traditionally has come from a mix of federal and state sources. For example, the entity said a local source that will provide nearly $500 (Recommendation 7) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to CEQ, EPA, OMB, and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, and the Interior. We also provided the California Delta Stewardship Council a draft of this report for review and comment. Dredging businesses.

Dredging businesses work with the California State Water Resources Control Board to help fund the San Francisco Estuary Institute’s water quality monitoring program. Water contractors. In an email from CEQ’s Deputy General Counsel, CEQ provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. In oral comments provided on August 8, 2018, OMB staff suggested some additional language to the report. In oral comments provided on August 8, 2018, OMB staff suggested that OMB should “assess whether to” update OMB’s written guidance for federal and state agencies on submitting data for the budget crosscut reports. Also, according to our analysis of survey responses, 27 of 48 federal and nonfederal entities indicated that it would be very or extremely important to have reports on federal obligations, and 24 of the 48 entities indicated that it would be very or extremely important to have reports on state obligations. The San Francisco Bay Delta Conservation and Development Commission. The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission plans, collaborates on, and regulates the San Francisco Bay, Bay shoreline, and Suisun Marsh; it also permits projects that fill or extract materials from the Bay. According to the record of decision, CALFED’s water quality goal was to provide good water quality for the millions of Californians who rely on the Delta for all or a part of their",
  "s investments, or releases of larger projects. For example, the Defense investment in our sample was the seventh increment of an ongoing investment; Energy’s system was the first of two phases; the DHS investment was rolled out to two locations prior to deployment to 37 additional locations; and Transportation’s investment had been part of a prototype deployed to four airports. Common factors critical to the success of three or more of the seven investments were: 1. Program officials were actively engaged with stakeholders. 2. Program staff had the necessary knowledge and skills. 3. Senior department and agency executives supported the programs. 4. End users and stakeholders were involved in the development of requirements. 5. End users participated in testing system functionality prior to formal end-user acceptance testing. 6. Government and contractor staff were stable and consistent. 7. Program officials had the necessary knowledge and skills. 8. Programs received sufficient funding. These critical factors help support OMB’s objective of improving the management of large-scale IT investments. As a result, the agency reported that it intends to update its policies and process for CIO certification of adequate incremental development and described planned actions to implement it. As a result, the agency’s policy and process for CIO certification of adequate development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful.

As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies increase the risk that the potential impact of utilizing incremental development to more quickly deliver useful functionality to users and improve the likelihood that these multimillion dollar projects will meet their stated goals, may not be realized. As a result, the officials in the GSA Office of the CIO stated that they are enabling the business customers to serve as better product owners. In May 2014, we reported that, by implementing this change, project staffs have (1) defined and prioritized clearer requirements; (2) selected the proper technical tools to support business needs; and in some cases, the proposed dates for completion have changed several times. In addition, several policies were still being developed. Therefore, we cannot be assured that these documents will fully address the areas we noted in this report. OMB’s fiscal year 2017 CIO certification policies are not consistent with OMB’s CIO certification policies. OMB staff reported that development work was slowed by inefficient governance and oversight processes; 5 agencies reported that development schedules were impeded by procurement delays; 5 agencies identified the lack of funding as their top challenge; 5 agencies identified the lack of stable, prioritized requirements as a challenge. In addition, 3 agencies identified a new challenge which had not been described in our prior work. One approach to reducing software development risks is to divide investments into smaller parts, or increments. While a traditional waterfall software development effort usually is broadly scoped, incremental development is a more complex process. One approach to reducing software development risks is to reduce software development risks. One approach to reducing software development risks is to reduce software development risks. In addition, GSA officials stated that they had experienced delays in meeting their incremental projects’ delivery schedules due to dependencies on multiple complex projects. These officials told us that the agency addressed these delays by improving existing processes and implementing a change control board and an enterprise test development environment. SBA officials reported that delays were introduced when the agency did not have necessary software and hardware available for development activities. Officials noted that these challenges were a result of the agency not maintaining an updated inventory of approved software and developers not having access to laptops needed for development activities. Officials noted that these challenges were a result of the agency not maintaining an updated inventory of approved software and developers not having access to laptops needed for development activities. SBA officials stated that the agency addressed the lack of approved software and equipment needed for incremental development by processing a waiver to use software tools and procuring laptops needed for development activities. Incremental development work was slowed by inefficient governance and oversight processes. Officials from the Office of the CIO at five agencies (Education, HUD, Interior, OPM, and USDA) reported that, while progress has been made in addressing this high-risk area, significant work remains to be completed. For example, as of December 2016, OMB and agencies had implemented 366 (or about 46 percent) of the 803 open recommendations that we had made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015 related to IT acquisitions and operations. As of August 2017, none of the agencies had taken action to address the recommendation; as discussed later in the report. We issued an update to our high-risk report in February 2017 and noted that, while progress has been made in addressing this high-risk area, significant work remains to be completed. For example, as of December 2016",

In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets that did not have intermediate targets. In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets that did not have intermediate targets. In these 10 targets, the Study identified how much progress would need to be made each year to achieve each target’s numerical goal by 2035. The TMDL also calls for implementing management actions for nitrogen entering the Sound from other states where feasible. In the TMDL, Connecticut and New York identified the need for an adaptive management approach because it would require nitrogen reduction beyond the limits of technology current at the time. The states also agreed to reassess the nitrogen reduction goals and revise the TMDL. In a letter signed by the Regional Administrators of EPA Region 1 and Region 2, EPA stated that the report is timely because the Study is working to transition from the 1994 plan to evaluating and reporting on the 2015 plan and highlighted steps the agency will take to meet our recommendations. The 2015 plan has four goals, associated with four themes: clean water and healthy watersheds. Clean water and healthy watersheds. The goal associated with four themes are as follows. Clean water and healthy watersheds. In the TMDL, Connecticut and New York identified the need for an adaptive management approach because it would require nitrogen reduction beyond the limits of technology current at the time.

In a letter signed by the Regional Administrators of EPA Region 1 and Region 2, EPA stated that the Study only assigned 75 percent of the 139 implementation actions in the 2015 plan to these four ranges. Instead of a cost range, the Study identified the funding needs for more than This appendix provides information on the scope of work and the methodology used to examine (1) what is known about the progress made toward achieving the 1994 Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (1994 plan); (2) the goals of the 2015 plan; (3) the goals of the 2015 plan; and (4) the goals of the 2015 plan; and (5) the factors that may hinder progress toward the goals of the 2015 plan. In our review of the 2015 plan is the Mussel Watch program, run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science. The Study reported that increasing the number of public access points may be difficult because there are many privately owned properties along the Long Island Sound coast. We did not identify any factors that may hinder progress toward the goals. We did not identify any factors that may hinder progress toward the goals. The 2015 plan defines outcomes as “broad results needed to achieve the goals.” For example, as shown in table 4, an outcome associated with the “clean water and healthy watersheds” theme is “to improve research, monitoring, and modeling for water quality.” Each outcome has multiple associated objectives, which are the accomplishments needed to achieve each outcome, and each objective has multiple strategies. By working with the Study as it finalizes its reporting format to incorporate the leading practices of performance reporting, EPA could help ensure that the Study provides the public and Congress with the information they need to determine whether the Study is making progress toward achieving the long-term targets associated with the goals of the 2015 plan, or whether the Study should take additional action to meet the targets. Study members estimated in the 2015 plan that future restoration activities would cost at least $18.9 billion over 20 years. Nearly all the amount was for activities addressing the goal to achieve clean waters and healthy watersheds.",
  "ngthen Oversight of Select Agents. GAO-18-197T. Washington, D.C.: November 2, 2017. High-Containment Laboratories: Coordinated Actions Needed to Enhance the Select Agent Program’s Oversight of Hazardous Pathogens. To determine how DOD has implemented the recommendations from the Army’s 2015 investigation report and has developed an approach to measure the effectiveness of actions taken to address the recommendations, we reviewed the Army’s 2015 investigation report recommendations and assessed the subsequent actions that DOD had taken to address those recommendations. To determine whether specific recommendations have been addressed, we analyzed guidance that DOD and the Army issued to instruct department and military service activities on roles and responsibilities and implementation efforts to support DOD’s BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program, such as DOD Instruction 5210.88, Security Standards for Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT); Army Directive 2016-24, Department of Defense Biological Select Agent and Toxins Biosafety Program; and Implementation Guidance for Army Directive 2016-24. To accomplish these things, a strategy and implementation plan can include such things as long-term goals, objectives, external factors that can affect goals, external factors that can affect goals, use of metrics to gauge progress, and a time frame for completion. Another key safety improvement DOD took in response to the incident at Dugway Proving Ground was to improve quality control and assurance at Dugway and other DOD facilities that currently handle BSAT. The Army’s 2015 investigation report made several recommendations to the Army to improve quality control and assurance at Dugway and other DOD facilities that currently handle BSAT. The Army’s 2015 investigation report made several recommendations to the Army to enhance and improve quality control and assurance at Dugway and other DOD facilities that currently handle BSAT. The Army’s 2015 investigation report made several recommendations to the Army to enhance and improve quality control and assurance at Dugway and other DOD facilities that currently handle BSAT. The Army’s 2015 investigation report made several recommendations to the Army to enhance and improve quality control and assurance at Dugway Proving Ground. These included (1) establishing a quality control and assurance manager, (2) carrying out an environmental sampling and inspection program, and (3) developing and enhancing the video surveillance program. Army officials explained that a mitigation strategy has not been developed—and that there is no time frame for developing such a strategy—because there is no testing of BSAT materials under way at the BioTesting Division, since its BSAT registration has been withdrawn. According to Army officials, this condition could last for at least 1 to 2 years. As DOD completes a concept plan for the program and turns its attention to a strategy and implementation plan for the program over the long term, BBPO has an opportunity to incorporate the following key elements typically found in such strategies and implementation plans and specified in OMB guidance: long-term goals, objectives, external factors that can affect goals, use of metrics to gauge progress, evaluation of the plan to monitor goals and Without developing measures to prevent conflicts of interest, the Army will not have reasonable assurance of the independence of the BioTesting Division’s test and evaluation mission. DOD has not completed its BSAT infrastructure study to determine its infrastructure needs, as required by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017. DOD has not completed its BSAT infrastructure study to determine its infrastructure needs, as required by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017. DOD was to report to the congressional defense committees by February 1, 2017, among other things, on the results of its study to evaluate (1) the feasibility of consolidating covered facilities within a unified command to minimize risk, (2) opportunities to partner with industry for the production of BSAT and related services in lieu of maintaining such capabilities within the Army, and (3) whether operations under the BSAT production program should be transferred to another government or commercial laboratory that might be better suited to produce BSAT for non-DOD customers. In response to the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 and its requirement to implement a video surveillance program, BBPO officials stated that recommendations for the use of video surveillance are being established by the Quality Assurance Working Group that supports BBPO for all laboratories in each of the military services that handle BSAT. Because BBPO is focused on broader issues and not just the Army’s 2015 investigation report recommendations, BBPO officials have also compiled and consolidated recommendations and actions from multiple reports, including the Army’s 2015 investigation report, the DOD Review Committee Report, a DOD Inspector General report, and the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017. Figure 11 is a timeline of selected actions DOD has taken. Because BBPO is focused on broader issues and not just the Army’s 2015 investigation report recommendations, BBPO officials have also compiled and consolidated recommendations and actions from multiple reports, including the Army’s 2015 investigation report, the DOD Review Committee Report, a DOD Inspector General report, and the Army’s",

OBO has been using a variety of strategies to improve the security of the U.S. Embassy. OBO has been using a variety of strategies to improve the security of the U.S. Embassy. OBO has been using a variety of strategies to improve the security of the U.S. Embassy. OBO in the past has primarily used third-party contractors to meet needs that were genuinely of a temporary nature, such as to conduct planning surveys and staff overseas projects during construction. More recently, however, OBO has begun to rely more on third-party contractors to provide key professional capabilities, as evidenced by some recent contractor hiring announcements for OBO’s implementation of design-build utilizing the SED. In 2006, we reported that the SED approach and design-build delivery method had enabled OBO to make significant progress in completing new embassies and had helped to reduce the average time to complete projects to about 3 years (36.7 months). This was nearly 3 years faster than embassies built during the Inman era. However, while the SED approach enabled OBO to accelerate the construction of new embassies, some stakeholders raised concerns about the aesthetics, quality, location, and functionality of those facilities. As of September 2017 in our interviews with them, the OBO reported it was trying to cover these positions through temporary staff assignments for 2 to 3 months. As with Design and Engineering, we found examples of positions within Construction, Facilities, and Security Management, either on-site between OBO’s PD and the contractor or between OBO headquarters and the contractor, we found that this dynamic helped to more easily resolve challenges and facilitate project efficiency. One of the congressional findings in the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 was that unless embassy vulnerabilities are addressed in a sustained and financially realistic manner, the lives and safety of U.S. employees in diplomatic facilities will continue to be at risk from further terrorist attacks. State subsequently initiated the CSCP to construct new embassies. As of the end of fiscal year 2017, there were five construction contractors building new embassies under the CSCP. The CSCP is administered by OBO, which in April 2018 had about 1,135 direct-hire civil service personnel, U.S. Foreign Service officers, and personal services contractors stationed in Washington, D.C., and overseas. The Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 calls for new diplomatic facilities to be sufficiently sized to ensure that all U.S. government personnel at a post are located on a single secure site and that those facilities are set back not less than 100 feet from the site. The U.S. embassy is located within the municipality of Wassenaar, adjacent to The Hague. The U.S. Embassy is located in a building constructed in 1970 in Port Moresby’s business district. The U.S. Embassy is located in the municipality of Wassenaar, adjacent to The Hague. The U.S. Embassy is located in a building constructed in 1970 in Port Moresby’s business district. OBO’s decision to employ a unique glass curtain-wall system for that project and subsequent questions raised by Diplomatic Security about the design, led OBO to modify the contract to add (1) $2.2 million and have primary responsibility for overseeing the contractor. The responsibilities added to the statement of work are an effort to utilize and leverage the design firms to provide more support to OBO’s design, operating costs, and their overall public impact in representing the United States. Although State has built 77 new embassies since 1999 and at the end of fiscal year 2017 had another 21 under construction, the CSCP’s project delivery pace has fallen short of State’s 2005 target of constructing 150 new embassies by 2018. This is due, in part, to unexpected building requirements and the effects of inflation. According to OBO, State had not previously employed such a system in a completed embassy project and could not provide us with documentation analyzing the risks of such a feature to cost and schedule—which might have included potential delays to get Diplomatic Security’s approval of the design—compared with conventional concrete construction. As of the end of September 2017, OBO reported that State and the contractor had agreed to extend substantial completion to February 2019 after settling the contractor’s request for equitable adjustment, which had claimed that five events delayed construction: (1) a pre- engineered factory-manufactured building was shipped to Bishkek and assembled on an 11-acre, U.S. government-owned site in 1996. OBO reported that by 2008, the office’s need for more staff has been ongoing since 2014, which roughly corresponds with OBO’s full implementation of Excellence. In 2015, the staff within Design and Engineering conducted a workload and workforce review in preparation for the office",

For example, in fiscal year 2016, USDA awarded a $130,000 grant from its Technical Assistance and Training program to one organization that works with tribes. USDA also awarded a contract to the National Rural Water Association for it to employ a network of technical consultants who can provide on-site technical assistance to eligible systems, including tribally operated systems. IHS officials stated that they have not been able to provide technical assistance to eligible systems USDA prioritizes and selects projects to fund from its Native American program using a different process than IHS and EPA. USDA’s process involves tribes, working with USDA state offices, submitting project grant applications to the headquarters office. USDA state offices score project applications before submitting them to the headquarters office. USDA policy directs the program to make funds available according to priority, and the agency accepts and evaluates applications and awards grants throughout the year. USDA officials said the program maintains a wait list for eligible applications received after all available funds have been obligated each year. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. In its 2013 report, EPA estimated the costs of future tribal drinking water needs of public systems at approximately $2.4 billion. EPA does not, and is not required to collect information about future tribal wastewater infrastructure needs. Other agencies that provide tribes with assistance for drinking water or wastewater infrastructure projects do not—and are not required to— systematically identify tribal drinking water or wastewater infrastructure needs.

We expect to issue the results of this work in fall 2017. Our past work also identified a number of actions agencies need to take to make performance information more transparent. For example, in 2017, we found that there was a statistically significant difference between SES and non-SES managers reporting that they were held accountable for the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality. In 2017, we found that interagency collaboration had helped federal managers who indicated familiarity with APGs, they were not consistently reporting on their efforts to develop these measures. We recommended that OMB report on Performance.gov the actions that CAP goal teams are taking to develop performance measures and quarterly targets. According to the competition’s website, the winning team achieved a five-fold improvement. OMB agreed with this recommendation, it did not address it before reporting on the CAP goals was discontinued, as discussed earlier. There are statistically significant increases when compared to 1997, when these survey items were introduced. For example, an estimated 79 percent of SES managers and 64 percent of non-SES managers reported being held accountable to a great or very great extent for results of the programs for which they are responsible. However, agencies face challenges in ensuring their performance performance. In the time between our 2015 and 2017 High-Risk Updates, many of these high-risk areas have been addressed. For example, in the time between our 2015 and 2017 High-Risk Updates, there were 34 high-risk areas covering a wide range",
  " that are specifically restricted to protect complainants requesting confidentiality, along with records belonging to DODIG’s Office of Professional Responsibility—which handles internal DODIG misconduct complaints. The CIGIE Integrity Committee receives, reviews, and refers for investigation allegations of wrongdoing made against Inspectors General, designated staff members of an IG, and the Special Counsel and Deputy Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel. According to DODIG officials, as of January 2019, there were no known instances of anyone without a need to know actually accessing these records. These officials also stated that corrective action had been taken for each instance in table 6, including by blocking access to information while the underlying issues were resolved; that at no time was information available to the public; and that the instances did not result in any disclosure outside of DODIG’s Office of Professional Responsibility and the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel. DODIG has determined that its user access issues are broadly attributable to system administration and application problems, including permission changes resulting from system updates. To address such issues, DODIG has taken several remedial actions and identified additional recommended steps, including: reconciling user accounts and validating permissions related to restricted records; reviewing policies related to protecting complainant confidentiality and conducting awareness training with personnel, as appropriate; and developing enhanced user management procedures and internal controls related to establishing user accounts, reconciling current user permissions, and controlling access to whistleblower records by IG personnel. DODIG officials noted that DODIG’s internal process for reporting misconduct protected confidentiality somewhat or very well, or did not know if it did so. However, a positive perspective cannot be inferred from the respondents that reported not knowing whether or not DODIG’s internal process protects confidentiality (42 percent). According to DODIG officials, most of the complaints reviewed during this new process would have otherwise been investigated by DODIG or the military service IGs, with a negative impact on the overall timeliness of investigations. Authorizing the military service IGs to close and simultaneously notify the DODIG reprisal investigations directorate of actions taken for complaints relating to uncooperative complainants, untimely complaints, and withdrawn complaints. This has increased notification rates and decreased processing time, according to DODIG officials. This appendix provides information on the characteristics of DODIG’s internal process for reporting misconduct. Specifically, DODIG is responsible for investigating and overseeing DOD component investigations of complaints alleging reprisal against certain DOD civilian employees, and for investigating complaints alleging reprisal against DOD civilian employees, and for investigating complaints alleging reprisal against DOD contractor, subcontractor, grantee, and subgrantee employees. For complaints alleging reprisal against a military servicemember, DODIG has the authority to either investigate the complaint or refer it to a military service Criteria for assessing these goals include whether or not key documentation of the investigation—such as the incoming complaints and required notifications—are present in the proper folders in the case file, and whether start, end, or milestone dates have been recorded in the case management system. Criteria for assessing the completeness and accuracy of information in DODIG’s Office of the Ombuds; and (4) reporting misconduct through the internal DODIG process for DODIG employees to report misconduct. A survey specialist helped to develop these questions, and another survey specialist provided independent feedback on the questions to ensure that content necessary to understand the questions was included and that the questions could be answered accurately and completely. To minimize errors that might occur from respondents interpreting our questions differently than we intended, we pretested our survey with seven DODIG employees to ensure the clarity and reasonableness of the questions.

These totals accounted for an estimated 42 percent and 32 percent of the cocaine produced in those years, respectively. In 2008, the Colombian government began to nationalize 62 aircraft from INL and, in 2012, assumed full responsibility for their maintenance and operations. Several factors may explain these increases in the amount of cocaine seized. Several U.S. officials noted that increases in cocaine production means there is more cocaine to be seized in Colombia. Several U.S. officials noted that there is more cocaine to be seized in Colombia. As part of each POM, SOUTHCOM reports on the activities supported under the project code and reports on results relative to pre-established performance targets. Under the program, in exchange for voluntarily eradicating their coca crops, farmers receive cash assistance and technical support to help them transition to the cultivation of legal crops. However, according to USAID, the Colombian government is implementing the program in conjunction with the FARC. Separately, the Colombian government is implementing the program in conjunction with the FARC. As a result, USAID officials stated that the U.S. government’s ability to support the program is restricted because the FARC is still designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. USAID and State officials also pointed out a range of implementation problems with the program and stated that the plan has had little to no impact on the current coca cultivation trends in Colombia. However, according to USAID officials, the Colombian government is implementing the program in conjunction with the FARC. The Colombian government is implementing the program in conjunction with the FARC. As a result, USAID officials stated that aerial eradication was becoming less effective prior to the end of the spraying program in 2015. According to ICE officials, assigning more personnel to Colombian air and seaports would greatly increase seizures of cocaine, while another port is known for corruption and smuggling. This official believes that hundreds of tons of cocaine leave via containers carrying licit merchandise and reported that, for example, one interdiction operation targeting the port in Cartagena had resulted in the seizure of 35 tons of cocaine since 2015. According to ICE officials noted that the payment of stipends to farmers has begun before the eradication of coca because they find it easy to grow and are very responsive to price changes. The expert stated that the U.S. government and UN have procedures to verify their estimates, there were differences between the two sources in terms of the levels of production and cultivation reported due to differences in their estimating methodologies. The agreement on illicit crops and drug trafficking addresses a range of issues related to coca eradication and crop substitution, public health and drug consumption, and drug production and trafficking. As part of an “Operation Agamemnon II” that sought to disrupt and dismantle the coca cultivation operations in Colombia, the U.S. government and Colombia’s drug trafficking organizations, the Colombian government has been limited in its ability to implement alternative development programs in a number of coca cultivating areas due to policy and legal restrictions. For example, the Colombian government pledged to prioritize voluntary drug-crop substitution programs over forced eradication, and where forced eradication was necessary, to prioritize manual removal over aerial spraying. Other portions of the peace agreement also relate to counternarcotics activities. Following the conclusion of the U.S.-Colombia High Level Dialogue in March 2018, the U.S. and Colombian governments pledged to expand counternarcotics cooperation over the next 5 years with the goal of reducing Colombia’s estimated coca cultivation and cocaine production by 50 percent by the end of 2023. Accordingly, we have made relevant modifications to our narrative to further describe information in UN studies related to the results of eradication efforts. In its comments, USAID stated that it concurred with our recommendation that State lead a comprehensive review of the U.S. counternarcotics approach in Colombia. The program’s goal was to reduce coca cultivation and harvests by spraying coca fields with glyphosate. INL helped fund, plan, and operate the aerial eradication program. It provided the pilots, planning, aircraft, logistics, maintenance, and fuel to operate the program’s two spray bases. The author presented data from 2006 through 2012 which indicated a 38 percent decrease in eradication levels as well as a 38 percent decrease in coca cultivation. Another study concluded that the effects of eradication were nullified by coca growers’ ability to rapidly relocate their operations to other areas. In addition, according to the evaluation, USAID and the Colombian government frequently did not provide sufficient income to cover food costs or other expenses, making farmers highly vulnerable to resume coca cultivation. An April 2011 evaluation of USAID’s Integrated Governance Response program reported that some funded projects were at a standstill due to the delays by the Colombian local and regional governments in fulfilling their",

MDA has done little to document the requirements and process for issuing a TCD, resulting in an inconsistent and, at times, ad- hoc process.

MDA’s capability delivery documentation does not include information about the quality of modeling data. Additionally Additionally, funding is not requested for the verification, validation, and accreditation of some models used in BMDS assessments because MDA also performed an extensive upgrade to the boost vehicle to improve reliability and address obsolescence issues. Although the CE-II Block I will address some concerns with the CE-II design, MDA determined a more complete redesign of the CE-II was needed. MDA subsequently developed an acquisition strategy and began developing the new kill vehicle, called the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV). The RKV is intended to be more reliable, producible, testable, and cost effective. While initially planned for delivery in 2015 with Increment 6 in fiscal year 2017, the program successfully flew the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) range target to support a critical intercept test for the GMD element. The GMD element provides the warfighter capability to engage and destroy intermediate- and intercontinental-range ballistic missile threats for the protection of the United States. In fiscal year 2017, MDA made progress towards stabilizing LRDR’s design, by completing a preliminary design review in March 2017 and a critical design review in September 2017. The program also began production of long lead radar electronic components and awarded a military construction contract for the Mission Control Facility. Fiscal year 2017 was a seminal year for the GMD program, as it achieved a number of major accomplishments. Over the past several years, the GMD program developed the newest interceptor version equipped with the CE-II Block I EKV and C2 boost vehicle. The program conducted its first successful flight test of this interceptor in May 2017 when it successfully intercepted a target representative of an intercontinental ballistic missile—another first for the GMD system.

Prior to this change, instructional staff included those “whose primary responsibility is instruction, research, and/or public service” combined in a single category. After the change, instructional staff included only those whose responsibilities are primarily instructional or those “for whom it is not possible to differentiate between instruction or teaching, research, and public service because each of these functions is an integral component of his/her regular assignment.” The North Dakota and Ohio data used in the regression analyses include a small number of faculty (1.1 and 0.5 percent of observations, respectively) who are listed as teacher of record for more than 15 courses over the year, which may represent unusually high workloads or data anomalies. In our analysis of the North Dakota and Ohio data, we found that full-time contingent faculty are limited to full-time tenure-track faculty. As shown in table 7, we found that full-time contingent faculty in both states are paid about 60 percent less per course regardless of whether the population includes all faculty or is limited to primarily teaching faculty. We focused our analyses on a universe of postsecondary institutions that fit as close as possible to the IPEDS data. We used a universe of institutions that fit as close as possible to the following definition: Active, Title IV, degree-granting 2-year and 4-year primarily postsecondary institutions that are generally open to the public, have at least 15 full-time equivalent staff, and reported at least 1 instructional staff member or graduate teaching assistant. The number of postsecondary institutions can change from year to year due to new schools opening or existing schools closing or consolidating with other schools, as well as due to changes in how schools elect to report data to - institution pair observations—where faculty were listed once, by their employing institution. Each faculty-institution pair observation had variables describing the faculty member’s and institution’s characteristics, as well as counts of courses, students, and student credit hours taught by the faculty member at that institution (including by academic term and by course characteristics). In addition, administrators from several public institutions noted that, as a result of decreased state funding, they have become more reliant on tuition to meet their budget needs. They told us that hiring contingent faculty to focus on teaching rather than research allows the institution to offer more classes and serve additional students, which in turn, generates more tuition revenue. We excluded cases from our analysis if they were missing values for either total annual earnings (i.e., total pay) divided by the total courses taught within that same year because these variables were the primary components of pay per course. We found that, in general, they cannot employ tenure-track faculty for all courses because they can be more expensive to employ than contingent faculty. In addition to the long-term commitment associated with tenure, other costs may include spending to support research conducted by tenure-track faculty (e.g., investment in specialized labs or equipment). Legal or grant program requirements: Some administrators said that legal or grant program requirements affect their decisions regarding the utilization of contingent faculty. For example, administrators from several institutions told us that they had reduced teaching loads for part-time faculty because the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires certain employers to provide health insurance for employees working 30 hours or more per week. Administrators from another institution stated that they utilized in-house faculty and hired additional contingent faculty to staff a federal grant program aimed at providing training for inmates at correctional facilities because—after receiving notification that they had been awarded the grant—they had approximately 2-",
  " guidance states that contracting officers need to evaluate the estimated amount of reverse auction fees that will be paid when assessing whether prices are fair or reasonable. DHS’s May 2017 guidance states that contracting officers need to understand the estimated amount of reverse auction fees that will be paid when assessing whether prices are fair or reasonable. DHS’s May 2017 guidance states that contracting officers need to understand the fees charged by a provider, and determine and document that the fee structure represents a fair and reasonable cost and offers the best value to the government. In contrast, reverse auctions are intended to encourage multiple vendors to compete against one another to win a contract from the government by lowering the price for which the vendor is willing to sell a particular good or service. The buyer—typically a contracting official—then evaluates the technical proposals and bids, and selects a winning vendor—generally the bidder who submitted the lowest price bid with an acceptable proposal—to meet the government’s need. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-4841 or dinapolit@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Second, to correct for situations when the agency target price was lower than the winning bid, and would result in a calculated savings of less than $0, instead FedBid uses a target price equal to the winning bid, so that calculated savings equal $0. The Army has not provided any agency-wide guidance on FedBid’s fee structure, even though the Army awarded reverse auctions valued at approximately $326 million using these two providers. Our analysis included the total amount of fees paid by each agency in 2016 to each reverse auction provider and the amount of fees paid by each agency in 2016 for auctions with only one bidder. According to DLA officials, the agency’s declining use is largely due to a policy revision that no longer requires, but rather allows contracting officers to consider using reverse auctions for all procurements over $150,000. DHS did not concur with our recommendation that it provide information to contracting officials regarding available reverse auction providers. Agencies can use reverse auctions as a tool to further promote competition and lower prices, among other potential benefits. Our analysis included the total amount of fees paid by each agency in 2016 to each reverse auction provider and the amount of fees paid by each agency in 2016 for auctions with only one bidder. Further, none of the five agencies we reviewed have collected data on or assessed why the number of reverse auctions with only one bidder on existing contract vehicles was significantly higher than reverse auctions using open markets. OFPP’s June 2015 reverse auctions guidance states that agencies should be evaluating their experiences with reverse auctions and the effectiveness of existing practices and policies so that refinements can be made as necessary. DLA pays a flat fee to its reverse auction provider for use of the reverse auction platform. This payment mechanism is different from the fee arrangements in contracts between agencies and many other reverse auction providers, for which providers calculate fees on a per-transaction basis. In addition, DLA generally uses a reverse auction as a price negotiation We also asked numerous individual contracting officers about the various platforms the individual has used. No additional providers or platforms were identified as part of those efforts. We collected fiscal year 2013 through 2017 data on reverse auctions use from these reverse auction providers and analyzed it to identify the number of reverse auction providers and analyzed it to identify the number of reverse auctions conducted annually across the government and the dollar value of those reverse auctions. The Veterans Healthcare Administration amended its procurement manual again in October 2015 to lift the suspension of GSA Reverse Auctions, but kept in effect the suspension of all other reverse auctions, not including the reverse auction provider’s indirect fee. We also analyzed agency guidance to determine the extent of information provided to contracting officials on reverse auctions. We did not analyze the number of auctions that resulted in a contract award between the agency and a vendor in a particular year, according to provider data. We did not analyze the number of auctions that resulted in a contract award between the agency and a vendor in a particular year, according to provider data. We describe these as awarded reverse auctions. The dollar value of an awarded auction is based on the dollar amount of the bid selected for award; however, the dollar amount of the bid selected for award is not necessarily equivalent to the amount ultimately obligated on the resulting contract. We present the dollar value of agencies’ awarded auctions from 2013 through 2017 in constant fiscal year 2017 dollars using the Congressional Budget Office’s June 2017 Gross Domestic Product price index projection—the most recent projection available at the time of our analysis. We generally collected data from reverse auction providers because information about reverse auction use is not available in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation, a government-wide source of contract data. In addition, the selected agencies we reviewed do not separately track use of reverse auctions. (Recommendation 12) The Secretary of reverse auctions.",
  "’s annual congressional appropriations.’s annual congressional appropriations. Cost-reimbursement type contracts allow the agency to contract for work when circumstances do not allow the agency to sufficiently define its requirements or estimate its costs to allow for a fixed-price contract. Of nine occasions since fiscal year 2013 that an NNSA contractor received at least one Satisfactory goal rating (below 50 percent), the overall rating for the contractor remained Good or Very Good, and contractors were provided the majority of their fees in all but one case (the contractor for Los Alamos National Laboratory in fiscal year 2014, which we discuss further below). For example, following the break-in of trespassers and related security lapses at Y-12 in 2012, NNSA provided the M&O contractor with Satisfactory ratings in operations in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. However, Very Good and Excellent ratings in other areas meant NNSA provided an overall rating of Good to the contractor in those years, and the contractor received more than 50 percent of available award fees. The M&O contract type made it difficult to determine how much of the available award fee is provided to the contractor. According to DOE officials, certain aspects of how DOE implements cost-reimbursement contracts are considered high risk for the government because of the potential for cost escalation and because the government pays a contractor’s costs of performance regardless of whether the work is completed. As such, cost-reimbursement contracts are suitable only when (1) circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract. In September 2009, we reported that cost-reimbursement contracts are considered high risk for the government because of the potential for cost escalation and because the government pays a contractor’s costs of performance regardless of whether the work is completed. As such, cost-reimbursement contracts are suitable only when (1) circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract; or (2) uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract. One major reason for the inability to accurately estimate costs is the lack of knowledge of the work needed to meet the requirements of the contract in fiscal year 2016. In addition, according to DOE officials, M&O contract budgets (the amount contractors are allowed to spend) are not set up front in the original contract. Rather, according to DOE officials, M&O contract budgets are commonly determined by the amount DOE obligates to the contract on an annual basis, based mostly on annual congressional appropriations to the relevant DOE programs. Further, these officials noted, because much of DOE’s appropriated funds are available for the M&O contractor’s performance during fiscal year 2016, while Table 16 contains the fiscal year 2016 subjective criteria for evaluating the WIPP M&O contractor’s performance. The following tables and figure provide details on the incentives available to and earned by EM’s M&O contractors from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2016. To illustrate the detailed formulas and calculations involved, Figure 13 provides excerpts from a performance evaluation report as an example of how ratings and fees are calculated. In March 2017, we reported that DOE needed quality data to manage its risk of fraud and recommended that DOE require contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with amounts charged to the government. While collecting, measuring, and reporting quality cost performance information may be challenging, such information is important for fully assessing contractor performance and managing the inherent risks of cost-reimbursement contracts. By updating their policies to require quality cost performance information in PERs to enable an overall assessment of M&O contractor cost performance, the six DOE offices with M&O contracts could strengthen their oversight of costs for contracts worth about $20 billion a year and use this information to improve acquisition decision-making. While collecting quality information on, measuring, and reporting on cost performance for M&O contracts may be challenging, this information is important for two reasons. First, the FAR, DOE policy, and CPARS highlight the importance of information on contractor’s cost performance for acquisition decision-making. As we previously noted, the FAR and DOE policy provide that decisions to extend or compete an M&O contract be based on an expectation of meaningful improvement in performance or cost, including consideration of a contractor’s technical, administrative, and cost performance. In addition, the FAR, DOE policy, and CPARS highlight the importance of information on contractor’s cost performance for acquisition decision-making. In the absence of documented, detailed procedures, NNSA may not consistently collect and use performance information from program managers and field office officials for contracts in a given fiscal year and may therefore inconsistently apply NNSA’s evaluation process. All of DOE’s offices have documented policies outlining their performance evaluation approaches, and all but NNSA have documented how information is to be collected and used to make",
  "s CFO, Chief Risk Officer, or other staff responsible for fraud risk management activities. The roundtable discussion was held March 26, 2018, and included three sessions: an opening session, a breakout session, and a closing session. The Standards for Internal Control state that management should implement control activities through policies and documentation and externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity’s objective. Until OMB provides additional guidelines directing agencies to report more-complete and more-detailed information related to their progress on both financial and nonfinancial risks, some agencies may continue to report incomplete information on their progress on FRDAA. OMB’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and OMB’s Office of Financial Management and OMB’s Office of Financial Services (OMB) and OMB’s Office of Financial Services (OMB) and OMB’s Office of Financial Management and OMB’s Office of Financial Services (OMB) and OMB’s Office of Financial Services (OMB) and OMB’s Office of Financial Management and OMB’s Office of Personnel and Performance Management regarding their development of FRDAA. After the breakout session, GAO facilitators and subject-matter experts on the engagement team then met to create a new list of the top challenges to implementing FRDAA, and to determine the extent to which OMB’s efforts to facilitate agency implementation of FRDAA were viewed as helpful. OMB Circular A-136 is sufficient guidance because it includes the requirements stated in FRDAA, while 18 percent indicated that they do so regularly, while 18 percent indicated that they do so but not on a regular basis. See figure 4 for additional information on the frequency with which agencies indicated they perform fraud risk management activities related to FRDAA requirements for financial and administrative controls. For example, some roundtable participants stated that clearer requirements, such as information on what activities would be considered compliant with the act, would be helpful to better implement FRDAA. In particular, two agencies identified grants and contracts as an area where additional guidance on managing fraud risks would be helpful. OMB Circular A-136 establishes reporting guidance for executive branch entities required to submit agency financial reports. For example, 86 percent of agencies indicated they used findings from monitoring, auditing, or evaluation of fraud risk activities after the enactment of FRDAA, compared with 79 percent of agencies that indicated they used such findings before FRDAA. See figure 5 for a comparison of the number of agencies reporting that they undertook fraud risk management activities before and after FRDAA. The leading practices in the Fraud Risk Framework are organized into four components—commit, assess, design and implement, and evaluate and adapt—as depicted in figure 1. Legislation and guidance has increasingly focused on the need for program managers to take a strategic approach to managing risks, including fraud. FRDAA was enacted to improve federal agency controls and procedures to assess and mitigate fraud risks, and to improve agencies’ efforts to implement FRDAA. These four components of the framework— commit, assess, design and implement, and evaluate and adapt— collectively encompass the type and level of detail in guidance that agency managers need to implement FRDAA, and, as outlined in the framework and Standards of Internal Control, should be present in some form to be effective. As a result, our analysis of the completeness of agencies’ annual financial reports is based on whether they contain each of 11 specific reporting elements. See appendix I (table 2) for additional information about these reporting elements. The 24 CFO Act agencies each included fraud-reduction sections in their annual financial reports as FRDAA requires but, at times, the completeness and detail of reporting was limited because some agencies did not completely address all of the elements specified in the FRDAA. As examples of these recent reforms, in March 2017 the President issued an executive order requiring a proposed plan to reorganize executive branch agencies. In April 2017, OMB provided guidance to federal agencies for developing their reform and workforce- reduction plans, as required by the President’s executive order. Executive Order 13781—Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch—and other recent administration actions prompted OMB to issue a memorandum (M-17-22), that required agencies to submit an agency reform plan to OMB by September 2017. These reform plans were part of OMB’s fiscal year 2019 budget submission to OMB that included long-term workforce reductions. In addition, OMB provided guidance to federal agencies for developing their reform and workforce- reduction plans, as required by the President’s executive order. In addition, without clarifying that FRDAA’s requirements must be addressed for all fraud risks— including those that agencies may have assessed and determined are not enterprise-level risks—agencies may not follow through on the additional steps of FRDAA, as required by the President’s executive order.",

We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to November 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. As of June 2018, the Secret Service did not provide evidence that the Secret Service had implemented any of the required practices for the IT workforce. As of June 2018, the Secret Service did not provide evidence that it had implemented any of the three selected practices within the workforce area. As such, based on DHS’s October 2016 IT acquisition review guidance, none of these contracts needed to be submitted to DHS OCIO for review. We also interviewed Secret Service officials, including the CIO and Deputy CIO, regarding the Secret Service’s implementation of the 14 selected component-level responsibilities. As of June 2018, the Secret Service did not provide evidence that it had implemented any of the three selected practices within the workforce area.

The Secret Service’s IT workforce may not have been identified as mission-critical occupations. The Secret Service had substantially implemented two of the areas and minimally implemented three of the areas, as of June 2018. In addition, the Secret Service was unable to demonstrate that it had sustained improvement in the morale of its IT staff. In addition, in accordance with leading practices, the Secret Service had minimally implemented three of the areas and minimally implemented three of the areas for its IT workforce. In addition, of the 15 selected leading practices associated with these workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service had fully implemented 3 practices, partly implemented 8 practices, and did not implement any aspects of 4 practices. To that end, the department identified core metrics that its agile IT programs are to use to monitor progress. In addition, the Secret Service’s Inspection Division in December 2017 (the assessment found that the majority of the Secret Service’s IT employees rated their morale as “very good” or “excellent.”) While the component also provided certain employee morale results from the Office of Personnel Management’s Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey in 2017, these results were not specific to the IT workforce. Instead, OCIO manually tracked the technical training that certain IT staff took. However, as discussed earlier, OCIO did not define the technical training that certain IT staff took. As such, the office was unable to ensure that the Secret Service has not developed a charter for its Executive Resources Board. As such, the office was unable to ensure that IT staff received the appropriate training relevant to their respective positions. Until it ensures that IT staff complete training specific to their positions (after defining their roles and responsibilities), the Secret Service has not established a charter for its Executive Resources Board. In addition, the Secret Service has not established a strategic workforce planning and management practices. In addition, the Secret Service initiated the IITT investment, which is intended to modernize and enhance the component’s infrastructure, communications systems, applications, and processes. In particular, IITT is a portfolio of programs and projects that are meant to, among other things, improve systems availability in support of the Secret Service’s business operations, increase interoperability with other government systems and networks, enhance the component’s system and network security, and enable scalability to support growth. From 2010 to July 2018, according to OCIO officials, the Secret Service spent approximately $392 million on IITT. In addition, to identify any IT contracts that were not included in the list provided by the Secret Service, we conducted a search of the Federal Procurement Data System – Next Generation to identify all unclassified contracts that (1) the component awarded between October 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017; (2) were not a modification of a contract; and (3) were associated with 1 of the 79 IT product or service codes identified by the Category Management Leadership Council. In particular, the Secret Service had not established and tracked metrics for monitoring the effectiveness of its recruitment and hiring activities for the IT workforce. The Secret Service had not established and tracked metrics for monitoring the effectiveness of its recruitment and hiring activities for the IT workforce, including their effectiveness at addressing skill and staffing gaps, and report to agency leadership on progress addressing those gaps.

We found that the development of knowledge involves feedback and interaction at these different stages of the cycle. Alternative innovation models include the following: Extended pipeline model. Some of these partnerships have led to development of transformational technologies. For example, in the 1970s DOD supported development of a communications network to facilitate information sharing, which is considered the foundation of the modern internet. According to this expert, the financial assistance federal research programs provide can send an important signal to universities that can lead to evolving academic programs and hiring in interdisciplinary fields. A 2016 MIT report made similar observations and said Similarly, in a 2012 report, the National Research Council stated that manufacturing is integral to new product development, and production lines are linked to an iterative innovation chain that includes research and development, product refinement, and full-scale production. In many high-technology industries, design cannot be easily separated from manufacturing, and talent availability is the most important factor for deciding where to place a production facility. In some cases, according to this 2012 report, companies are choosing to produce abroad because of concerns related to the capacity of the U. S. supply chain, technical skills of U.S. workers, and the investment climate for high-volume manufacturing. We also provided a draft of this report to a participant who served as a member of the QIS Subcommittee, it has not fully implemented the relevant leading collaboration practices we identified. For example, by developing a charter that identifies its high-level purpose and functions and that identifies co-chairs for the group, the QIS Subcommittee has taken initial steps to identify some agencies’ roles and to establish means for operating across agency boundaries. Moreover, by having a charter signed by senior officials, the QIS Subcommittee has taken steps to document agencies’ agreement to collaborate, which is a key feature of collaborative mechanisms we have identified in our prior work. According to this report, manufacturing is important in developing new products because in many high-technology industries, design cannot easily be separated from manufacturing, and a lack of sustained investment in research and infrastructure threatens to damage the U.S. innovation ecosystem, economy, and security. A Google official told us that the company has been working for several years to build a quantum computer through the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab. In a March 2018 press release, Google announced its",
  " of the electricity system while also noting the need for further research to fully understand the specific threats to components of the grid that would allow suppliers to protect against these events. While noting the need for further research, some of these studies vary with regard to their assessment of the likelihood of long-term, widespread damage to the grid from HEMP. To do this, system operators utilize a system of sensors and controls to monitor power consumption and generation from a centralized location. Operators use computerized systems to send signals to power plants and other grid components to adjust their output to match changes in consumption. Electromagnetic events can interrupt or damage some of the equipment system operators use, which can cause a disturbance in control systems (for example, such events can cause relays to unintentionally operate, which can disable system protection equipment). In June 2014, FERC approved standard EOP-010-1, submitted by NERC. In June 2014, FERC approved standard EOP-010-1, submitted by NERC, requiring that certain suppliers prepare for the effects of GMD events by developing contingency operating plans, procedures, and processes. FERC approved a second standard—TPL- 007-1—in September 2016, also submitted by NERC, requiring certain suppliers to assess the vulnerability of their transmission systems to GMD events.

Officials in DOE’s Office of the CIO stated that the department is in the process of determining ways to add specific review criteria to its capital planning policies and procedures to identify how the department is to review the appropriateness of IT resources. This requirement was assigned at the department level. HHS documented IT capital planning procedures for the level of detail of planned expenditure reporting. However, the procedures had not explicitly required that all transactions with an IT component are included in the expenditure reporting. This requirement was assigned at the department level. HHS documented IT capital planning procedures for including the CIO in the planning and budgeting stages for the sampled investment by reviewing and approving the investment’s budget request. However, at the time of our review, the department had not demonstrated that the CIO was included in the planning and budgeting stages for the sampled investment by reviewing and approving the investment’s budget request. However, HHS could not demonstrate that the CIO was included in the planning and budgeting stages for the sampled investment by reviewing and approving the investment’s budget request. However, HHS could not demonstrate that the CIO was included in the planning and budgeting stages for the sampled investment by reviewing and approving the investment’s budget request. However, the delegation plans they provided to us did not include such procedures. Officials in Treasury’s Office of the CIO stated that they did not believe that it was their responsibility to have procedures for verifying the CIO’s role in reviewing IT resources that are to support major program objectives and significant increases and decreases in IT resources. (Recommendation 14) The Administrator of NNSA should direct the Office of the CIO and other offices, as appropriate, to take steps that agencies are to take to establish a basic set of roles and responsibilities (the common baseline) for CIOs and other senior agency officials. One such action is that agencies are to conduct a self-assessment to determine whether their current policies and procedures meet or do not meet the common baseline requirements. If the agencies do not meet the requirements, they are to submit an implementation plan describing the changes they intend to make to their policies and procedures in order to ensure that the common baseline requirements are met. Further, the guidance notes that senior agency officials—including Chief Financial Officers and Chief Acquisition Officers—are to work in partnership to facilitate successful implementation of the common baseline and to ensure the CIO is a strategic partner in agency strategies, budgets, and operations. In such cases, we based our determination of departments’ implementation of the information technology (IT) budgeting requirements by developing and implementing policies and procedures that document the level of detail of planned expenditure reporting to the CIO for all transactions that are fully or partially supported with IT resources. In addition, the relevant documentation was not retained for the selected department-level investments because procedures were not in place to document reviews by the CIO and certain department-level CIOs. In addition, DOE could not demonstrate that the CIO was involved in the planning or that the CIO was included in the planning or that the responsibility had been delegated to the division. FBI could not demonstrate that the CIO was included in budget decisions for all programs with IT resources, including those within NNSA and national laboratories. According to DOE’s FITARA implementation plan and a memorandum from the Secretary providing further instructions on FITARA, NNSA was to provide an opportunity for the department CIO to provide input in its planning and budgeting stages for programs with IT resources and to document related review processes. However, at the time of our review, NNSA had not yet established the procedures that were to detail how this process was to be carried out. DOE developed charters that included the CIO and other offices, as appropriate, to take steps to ensure that the actions taken to comply with OMB’s common baseline for implementing FITARA on individual investments are adequately documented. However, HHS did not fully address the department-level requirement in that its process did not document how the department-level CIO would review and approve existing (as opposed to new) major investments greater than or equal to $20 million annually. As a result of not fully documenting the process for how the departments are to meet this requirement, DOE, HHS, and Treasury are at increased risk that the CIO is not providing input into key IT resource planning decisions.

As a result, the FSM government has not implemented any plans for the fiscal year 2023 transition from compact sector grants to trust fund income. As a result, the FSM government has not implemented any plans for the fiscal year 2023 transition from compact sector grants to trust fund income.

As a result, the FSM government has not implemented any plans for the fiscal year 2023 transition from compact sector grants to trust fund income. With regard to the civil aviation economic services of the programs and services agreements, DOT officials stated that, while the FSM and RMI could voluntarily decide to allow U.S. air carriers to continue operations in the FSM and RMI, new bilateral agreements would be needed to assure that result. U.S. Agency for International Development. Following a U.S. presidential disaster declaration, FEMA provides the funding for disaster relief and reconstruction, which is programmed through USAID. Under current law, FEMA provides the funding for disaster relief and reconstruction, which is programmed through USAID. Under current law, the FSM had not updated the Long- Term Fiscal Framework but had included information updates in its annual budget submittal. See appendix IV for a summary of the status of programs and services provided under the programs and services agreements after the agreements end. U.S. Agency for International Development. Following a U.S. presidential disaster declaration, FEMA provides the funding for disaster relief and reconstruction, which is programmed through USAID. Under current law, FEMA provides the funding for disaster relief and reconstruction, which is programmed through USAID. Under current law, FEMA funds will no longer be available for this purpose once the agreements end; however, USAID will be able to provide foreign disaster assistance funding to the FSM and RMI under the same terms as it provides this assistance to other countries. The annual decrements in assistance are added to the amounts deposited in the trust funds established under the amended compacts for the two nations. According to RMI government officials, significant growth in fishing fee revenue and growth in ship registry and income tax revenue has minimized the initially anticipated impact of the compact decrements, thereby reducing the need to implement expenditure reductions. The United States provides compact sector grants and trust fund contributions are partially adjusted for inflation each fiscal year. Appendix II provides additional information on the base and inflation-adjusted amounts of U.S. compact funds in fiscal years 2019 through 2023. In addition to scheduling the budget reductions, the RMI decrement management plan includes plans to implement new taxes, program fishing fees into the annual budget, reduce subsidies to state-owned enterprises, and reduce compensation to Majuro landowners for the use of their land for utilities. The RMI has programmed a portion of its fishing fee surplus into the annual budget in each fiscal year from 2015 to 2017 but has not implemented other planned actions. The compact trust fund committees have not yet prepared distribution policies, required by the trust fund agreements, that could assist the countries in planning for the transition to trust fund income. In addition, the committees have 1. Annual disbursements are reduced below the maximum allowable disbursement. 2. Additional annual contributions are made to the trust fund in fiscal years 2018 through 2023. 3. The trust fund agreement disbursement policies are modified to limit the annual disbursement to a fixed percentage of the fund’s annual grant assistance, as defined by the trust fund agreements), a continuing risk of zero disbursements, and a decreasing likelihood that the fund will maintain or exceed its inflation-adjusted balance in fiscal year 2023. The amended compacts’ implementing legislation incorporates by reference related agreements extending programs and services to the FSM and RMI. The programs and services agreement with each country identifies the following programs and services as being available to each country: U.S. postal services, weather services, civil aviation, disaster preparedness and response, and telecommunications. Each programs and services agreement extends for 20 years from the compact’s entry into force. For the RMI, the risk of zero disbursements would be reduced, but not eliminated, in each decade. For the RMI, the risk of zero disbursements would be reduced, but not eliminated, in each decade. For both countries, the likelihood that the funds would maintain or exceed their inflation-adjusted fiscal year 2023 value after fiscal year 2023 would be higher in each decade. The amended compacts’ implementing legislation (Pub. L. No. 108-188) and other U.S. legislation authorize other U.S. grants, programs, and services for the FSM and RMI. Pub. L. No. 108-188 authorized an annual supplemental education grant (SEG) for the FSM and RMI in fiscal years 2005 through 2023",

We identified existing literature through a literature search, and we confirmed the completeness of the literature with selected industry groups. The project characteristics we collected from the selected allocating agencies included the following: Address (street, city, state, and zip code) Construction type (new construction or rehabilitation) Income limits for low-income units Number of units (residential and non-residential) Number of units (low-income, market-rate, and employee-occupied) Square footage (gross and residential) Structural features (the presence of Existing structures: The purchased or appraised value of acquired structures. Land: The purchased or appraised value of acquired or leased land. The agencies in our sample did not consistently capture information on whether projects paid these wages. Proximity to transit or other amenities. Most of the selected allocating agencies required or awarded points to projects located near certain amenities such as grocery stores, hospitals, or public transit. However, none maintained readily accessible data indicating which completed projects had this characteristic. As shown in table 2, these other funding sources may have been used in addition to LIHTC projects. LIHTC projects may be subject to LIHTC requirements. We found that LIHTC projects may have had lower or no tax credit partnership and syndication costs. We found that LIHTC projects may have had lower or no tax credit partnership and syndication costs. The cost-management approaches were highly significant with and without the inclusion of federal and local transit data. The overall trends were substantially affected by certain allocating agencies. During 2011–2015, the median per-unit cost of allocating agencies were associated with about a $32,000 decrease in per-unit cost (or about 16 percent of the median per-unit cost). However, projects that received these loans or grants may have had unique characteristics that affected cost. According to an allocating agency official from California—where about 19 percent of the projects we reviewed used at least one Rural Development loan or grant—projects that received these funds may have had lower total development costs because high-cost projects were not financially feasible in some rural areas due to lower rents and less local public funding. In addition, projects to house seasonal farm workers that receive funding from Rural Development’s Section 514/516 Farm Labor Housing programs may lack some amenities—such as in-unit kitchens and bathrooms—that increase costs.

  ", we learned that the EAC has not finalized the requirements for the acquisition of voting equipment, such as covering only the costs of acquiring accessible voting equipment. Additionally, the EAC has developed a design concept and specifications for its new voting equipment and is in the process of soliciting and selecting vendors to manufacture it. It has acquired several functional prototypes of the current design for the new equipment, including developing testing programs, among other things, no systems had been certified under this version of the guidelines as of November 2017. According to the EAC, these guidelines are a set of specifications and requirements pertaining to voter registration, protecting the voting rights of certain minority groups, and other areas of the elections process. Officials stated that after conducting its assessment of the equipment, the committee presented its findings to the SBE, and in October 2014, the board selected the voting equipment to be acquired based on the committee’s recommendation. Congress has passed legislation in major functional areas of the voting process. For example, HAVA includes a number of provisions related to voting equipment and other election administration activities, including, for instance, requiring at least one voting system equipped for persons with disabilities at each polling place in federal elections. After HAVA was enacted, Congress appropriated more than $3 billion for voting equipment to meet applicable federal, state, and local voting system standards and requirements is a factor considered by local election jurisdictions and states when determining whether to replace equipment.

In addition, the county used $12,000 in local funds to purchase three additional BMDs. They noted that they needed to educate the public about both voting by mail and the new voting equipment. Officials stated that the county used local newspaper ads, social media posts, and direct mailings to provide information on these changes. The county’s new voting equipment was designed to be used in a manner that is consistent with the county’s current voting system. The county’s new voting equipment was designed to be used in a manner that is consistent with the county’s current voting system. The county’s new voting equipment was designed to be used in a manner that is consistent with the county’s current voting system. Officials stated that this effort was also intended to provide an alternative to the current vendor model that could reduce maintenance costs and annual licensing fees that are incurred with proprietary systems. In 2012, the county Clerk convened a group of election administrators, usability experts, and academic experts in computer science and statistics, and through a series of discussion sessions, developed the concept for the county’s new system, which they named STAR (Secure, Transparent, Auditable, and Reliable) Vote. According to the results of our local election jurisdiction survey, jurisdictions using the two main types of voting equipment (DRE or optical/digital scan) experienced mostly similar benefits as a result of using their respective type of voting equipment. At the polling place, voters would make their selections on a DRE device with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tablet, which would also be equipped with an auditory interface for visually impaired voters and other features to assist individuals with special needs. For example, according to officials, the ballot marking device is",
  "priority shipments for Defense military exercises and operations. In addition, analysts currently have to query up to 11 Defense and commercial carrier systems to compile a report on high-priority shipments across the combatant commands. Officials noted that these analysts often experience delays getting access to timely information and must also resolve conflicting information in various transportation systems. However, with the transition to cloud services, officials in USTRANSCOM reported that analysts will have the capability to automatically generate reports based on defined criteria, such as shipment method or destination, and use data to make decisions about how to best manage the use of cloud services. In addition, officials in the Office of the CIO and the Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security (OMB) reported that the agency has made significant improvements in the use of cloud services. In addition, officials in the Office of the CIO and the Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security reported that the agency made significant improvements in the use of cloud services.

In addition, the agency made significant improvements in the use of cloud services, with the percentage of increase varying from up to 10 percentage points to 20 or more percentage points. For the remaining six agencies, two reported no change in the percentage of investments using cloud services and four reported a decrease in the overall percentage of cloud usage. In addition, GSA officials reported that the agency used the savings from replacing the agency’s legacy on-premises email program with a cloud-based email system to implement a modern enterprise collaboration platform, email, and document storage system. According to the officials, the agency implemented bureau-specific data checks, including which accounts could be associated with item categories and cost centers, which has reduced user errors and improved the reliability of the data. Officials in the Offices of the CIO, and Office of Information Technology, at the six agencies that reported no change or a decrease in their cloud investment percentages during this 4-year period provided a variety of reasons for why this was the case, or had no comments regarding the lack of change in their cloud investment percentages. OMB publicly reports agencies’ responses to this question on the IT Dashboard. OMB publicly reports agencies’ responses to this question on the IT Dashboard. In addition, officials stated that the agency had not realized any cost savings for some investments because acquiring cloud services required that new business and performance requirements be put in place, which resulted in no overall savings for these investments. Further, DHS and SSA Officials in the Office of the CIO at the 15 agencies reported that acquiring cloud services had allowed them to achieve greater levels of mission assurance by streamlining security resources and improving backup capabilities that were not available previously. The agencies generally agreed with our recommendations and, to date, Defense and DHS have taken action to implement the recommendations. In addition, one agency broke down its savings data into savings and cost avoidances; we combined these reported figures for each investment and, after consultation with a GAO data subject matter expert, confirmed with all the other agencies in our review that their information on savings also included cost avoidances. In addition, the officials stated that the agency was able to implement a disaster response capability and improve the system’s operational efficiency, while also establishing more efficient environments for software development and testing. In addition, the officials reported that, in 2012, they had acquired software as a service for the agency’s virtual desktop solution. This new service provided agencies a means to buy the services faster and possibly at a lower cost than through the traditional methods of building and maintaining systems. In addition, in December 2017, the American Technology Council issued a Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization and made eight cloud computing- related recommendations that are relevant to the focus of our review. According to DHS officials in the Office of the CIO, moving to the cloud allowed VA to acquire more flexible and scalable technologies in order to scale resources up and down to meet demand, while incorporating a faster, more user-friendly design approach. The changes to OMB’s guidance for fiscal year 2019 provide a key improvement for ensuring that agencies establish more consistent processes for reporting cloud- spending,",

  ")(3) exemptions, FOIA requires each agency to submit a report to the U.S. Attorney General, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We met with these agencies to identify their involvement in providing assistance to companies related to TARP. In particular, they do not have documented plans that describe how they will implement best practices for reducing backlogs over time, including specifying how they will use metrics to assess the effectiveness of their backlog reduction efforts and ensure that senior leadership supports backlog reduction efforts and ensure that senior leadership supports backlog reduction efforts, among other best practices identified by OIP. While agencies with backlogs of 1,000 or more FOIA requests are required to describe backlog reduction efforts in their chief FOIA officer reports, these consist of a high-level narrative and do not include a specific discussion of how the agencies will implement best practices. We did not state whether they agreed or disagreed with all of the recommendations. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Multiple agencies also provided technical comments, which we have incorporated, as appropriate. The following 9 agencies agreed with our recommendations: In emails received from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the two agencies stated that they agreed with the recommendations in our report. In written comments, reprinted in appendix V, DHS stated that it concurred with our recommendations. In written comments, reprinted in appendix V, DHS stated that it concurred with our recommendations. Regarding the recommendation to designate a chief FOIA Officer, the department stated that it had delegated the full authority and responsibility of DHS’s FOIA operations and programs to the chief privacy officer. This includes specifying which agencies in our review with backlogs in the hundreds still experienced an increase over the 5-year period. In cases where an agency appeared to cite multiple statutes, such as 26 U.S.C. §§ 6103 and 6105, we counted the statutes separately if we determined they were different. In written comments, reprinted in appendix V, DHS requested that GAO consider this recommendation to be resolved and closed. As a result, an agency is required to provide the relevant record(s) in any readily producible form or format specified by the requester, unless the record falls within a permitted exemption that provides limitations on the disclosure of information. Figure 1 provides a simplified overview of the FOIA request and appeals process. In a typical agency, as indicated, during the intake phase, a request is logged into the agency’s FOIA tracking system, and a tracking number is assigned. The request is then reviewed by FOIA staff to determine its scope and level of complexity. The agency then sends a letter or email to the requester acknowledging receipt of the request, with a unique tracking number that the requester can use to check the status of the request. The remaining 3 agencies did not post all of their four required categories of online records, DOI officials stated that the agency does not make publicly available all FOIA records that have been requested three or more times, as it does not have the time to post all such records that have been requested. In particular, of the four agencies with the largest backlogs, only one— NARA—reduced its backlog. Agencies identified a variety of methods that they used to address their backlogs. These included both the practices identified by Justice, as well as additional methods. These agencies were: the Administrative Conference of the United States, FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and Treasury. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Office of the Secretary of State, and the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury. Figure 3 summarizes the extent to which the 18 agencies implemented the selected FOIA requirements. Beyond these selected agencies, Justice’s OIP and OMB also had taken steps to develop a government-wide FOIA request portal that is intended to allow the public to submit a request to any agency from a single website. The 2016 amendments to FOIA required agencies to include specific information in their responses when making their determinations on requests. If part of a request is denied, for example, agencies must inform requesters that they may seek assistance from the FOIA public liaison of the agency or OGIS, file an appeal to an adverse determination within a period of time that is not less than 90 days after the date of such adverse determination. The results of this analysis are not generalizable to all FOIA reporting agencies. For our third objective, to identify statutory (b)(3) exemptions that have been used by agencies as the basis for withholding information, we developed a catalog of (b)(3) statutes that agencies previously have used to withhold information in FOIA records. To do that, we retrieved all data on agency use of (b)(3) statutes that were",
  ", these Treasury officials said that the IRS is examining how plans are maintaining good records and what plans are doing to find and communicate with participants—officials are aware that additional guidance indicating what is expected of plan fiduciaries would be helpful. In two of the five locations we reviewed, Australia and Switzerland, plans transfer dormant accounts belonging to separated employees to a centralized institution that is actively monitored by regulators. These accounts generally remain within these institutions until claims for benefits are made by the participant. For example, Swiss officials told us that in the event of a change of employment, the pension scheme (i.e., plan) of an insured person (i.e., participant) transfers the accumulated assets on behalf of that person to the pension scheme of the new employer. In the United States, the pension scheme (i.e., plan) of an insured person (i.e., participant) transfers the accumulated assets on behalf of that person to the pension scheme of the new employer. Vested benefits institutions are used to hold the assets when a person ceases to be subject to occupational benefits (workplace retirement) plans owing to termination of employment, e.g. in connection with a career break or being laid off. In these cases, the pension scheme mandatorily transfers the assets to a vested benefits institution. This procedure ensures that the accumulated assets remain blocked in the pension cycle until the insured person joins a new pension scheme or an insured event occurs (old age, disability, or death). Once the person recommences employment and thus becomes subject to mandatory occupational benefits plans owing to termination of employment, e.g. in connection with a career break or being laid off. In these cases, the pension scheme mandatorily transfers the assets to a vested benefits institution. In these cases, the pension scheme mandatorily transfers the assets to a vested benefits institution. This procedure ensures that the accumulated assets remain blocked in the pension cycle until the insured person joins a new pension scheme or an insured event occurs (old age, disability, or death). According to an IRS publication on tax withholding for plan sponsors, a 20 percent income tax withholding generally is mandatory on amounts distributed from the plan that are not rolled over directly into another qualified plan or an IRA. However, our findings that some participants may not actually receive these distributions raise questions about whether withholding should be required in situations when it is reasonable to believe distributions will not be received by the participants. Misconceptions exist regarding how and when IRS will credit tax withholding toward a taxpayer’s tax liability. For example, two TPAs told us they believed that the IRS will credit tax withholding toward a participant’s tax liability (and not transferred to another pension fund established in _______ in a transfer that qualifies as a tax-deferred transfer under the laws of _______). In addition, the TPA executive, between 1994 and 2012 plan sponsors could ask IRS to provide information about tax withholding for U.S. individuals who participate in foreign retirement plans. The TPA executive, between 1994 and 2012 plan sponsors could ask IRS to provide information about tax withholding for U.S. individuals who participate in U.S. retirement plans.

In 2013 IRS provided information about tax withholding for U.S. individuals who are required to prepare returns in compliance with these U.S. laws, and, according to tax preparers with whom we spoke, the cost for having a complete tax return professionally prepared for an individual holding a foreign retirement account ranges from $1,800 to as high as $16,000. Determining how a foreign retirement account should be reported is time consuming even for experts. IRS officials said if the agency were to add the failure to report distributions to the list the penalty would likely encourage some sponsors to update the data as required. IRS officials said if the agency were to add the failure to report distributions to the list the penalty would likely encourage some sponsors to update the data as required. IRS also agreed to work to improve the likelihood that the Notice of Potential Private Pension Benefit Information corresponds to actual retirement benefits in the future, and to clarify for the public the Internal Revenue Code’s requirements. IRS officials said if the agency were to add the failure to report distributions to the list the penalty would likely encourage some sponsors to update the data as required.

  ". Nevertheless, the overall allowance rate for the ALJ is approximately the same as the rate for the other ALJ cases in the national economy. However, the impact on allowance rates in the research we reviewed is mixed. SSA has employed a range of efforts to monitor the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions, but it lacks performance measures to report publicly on these efforts. We calculated allowance rates by dividing the number of favorable decisions by the total number of decisions (both unfavorable and favorable). We calculated allowance rates for different units of analysis: Overall, by program type (Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, and other programs) SSA’s assessment of the ALJ is based on a number of factors. SSA’s assessment of the ALJ is based on a number of factors and processes. SSA made several other comments about one of our conclusions and our analysis of variation in administrative law judge allowance rates, which we discuss below. SSA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. In its comments, SSA described its evolving oversight activities at the hearings level, including providing policy guidance and training for judges, capturing and utilizing data to gain a better understanding of trends and challenges, and implementing additional oversight review processes, all of which we discussed in our report. SSA continues to develop and implement initiatives aimed at improving hearing decisions, without evaluating the potential for overlap with existing quality assurance reviews. For example, as part of its backlog reduction plan known as the Compassionate And Responsive Services (CARES) plan, SSA is using computer algorithms for natural language processing to analyze the text of disability decisions. The standard deviations of the allowance rates on the logit scale are explicit parameters in the model and were directly estimated with the fixed coefficients. We used these distributions to describe variation across judges, offices, and diagnoses. SSA’s data on hearing cases are limited, partially because cases are dismissed without a review of medical evidence. SSA’s data on hearing cases are limited, partially because cases are dismissed without a review of medical evidence. SSA’s data on hearing cases are limited, partially because cases are dismissed without a review of medical evidence. SSA’s data on hearing cases are limited, partially because cases are dismissed without a review of medical evidence. For example, the impairment code from the hearings-level decision was missing for virtually 100 percent of dismissed cases. As part of SSA’s hearings-level decisions also increased during this same time period, from 426 days to 543 days. During these years, the number of ALJs declined, along with the number of case dispositions per month. Our classification of allowances for concurrent cases differs from SSA’s usual practice (although a 2017 internal study of ALJ allowance rates used the same method as ours). SSA’s data on dismissed cases are limited, partially because cases are dismissed without a review of medical evidence. SSA officials said that, since 2010, they have changed the way they train and mentor new judges, and introduced new tools to help provide a standardized SSA also conducts multiple quality assurance reviews, but some of these reviews may overlap and SSA has not evaluated them. Prior to 2010, SSA generally only reviewed decisions that claimants appealed through the Appeals Council. While these quality assurance reviews have somewhat different focuses—for example, some assess aspects of how a case was processed while others review the accuracy of the decisions—they overlap in two key ways. We analyzed about 3.3 million decisions made by administrative law judges on adult Social Security disability appeals. We analyzed about 3.3 million decisions made by administrative law judges on adult Social Security disability appeals over this period. As part of SSA’s five-step process to determine eligibility for adult disability benefits, SSA uses a set of rules to evaluate how a claimant’s age, education, and work experience affect their remaining capacity for work. SSA’s criteria vary across four primary age groups—45-49, 50-54, 55-59, and 60 and older. The criteria are less stringent for claimants in older age groups than they are for younger claimants, because the rules assume that individuals at older ages may be less able to transition to other work. Impairment: Certain impairments were also strongly associated with the chance of being allowed benefits (see fig. 7). For example, claimants with primary impairments recorded in SSA’s data of heart failure or multiple sclerosis were allowed benefits at rates 4.2 and 5 times higher, respectively, than typical claimants with heart failure or multiple sclerosis. This variation in allowance rates persisted, but fell modestly over time, even when we used multivariate statistical methods to hold constant a variety of factors related to the disability appeals process. These factors included characteristics of claimants, judges, and hearing offices, as well as the distribution of allowances and denials over the five steps. The data we assembled had a multilevel structure, with applications for disability benefits, including",
  "in response to the entity’s risks. In response to the entity’s risks. In determining the necessary level of precision for a control activity, management is to evaluate, among other things, consistency of performance. A control activity that is performed routinely and consistently generally is more precise than one performed sporadically. HUD officials have said that they consider rent-reform, work-requirement, and time-limit policies to have a great and direct impact on tenants. Although our draft report noted that leading practices for managing reserve funds include considering establishing a maximum reserve level, we did not recommend that HUD set such a reserve level for MTW agencies because we recognized the demonstration’s funding flexibilities. Rather, we recommended that HUD develop a process to monitor MTW agencies, including rent-reform, work-requirement, and time-limit policies. HUD also commented that by reviewing and granting approval for all MTW agencies, it already had a process to determine if spending of reserve funds was reasonable. However, as HUD noted in its comments on the draft report’s third recommendation, we used statistical techniques to improve on simple comparisons between MTW agencies and non-MTW agencies because we recognized the demonstration’s funding flexibilities. However, MTW agencies are not allowed to define self-sufficiency for each activity that is tied to the demonstration’s funding flexibilities. In addition, MTW agencies are not allowed to define self-sufficiency for each activity that is tied to the demonstration’s funding flexibilities. In addition, MTW agencies are not allowed to define self-sufficiency for each activity that is tied to this HUD metric. In addition, MTW agencies are allowed to define self-sufficiency for each activity that is tied to this HUD metric. MTW agencies’ definitions of self-sufficiency can diverge widely and sometimes are inconsistent within an MTW agency. Some examples include defining self-sufficiency as attaining a total gross household income at 80 percent of the area’s paying a minimum rent of $225; voluntarily terminating housing assistance and other forms of government assistance; and attaining a household income of 50 percent of the area median income, even if the family may be receiving other forms of government assistance.

MTW agencies are allowed to define self-sufficiency for each activity, including rent-reform, work-requirement, and time-limit policies. In this appendix, we summarize the statistical methods we used to analyze a dataset we assembled from administrative databases maintained by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Community Survey (ACS), conducted by the Census Bureau, to compare MTW and non-MTW agencies on these outcomes. Our analysis did not seek to conduct a definitive evaluation of the MTW This level of reliability was acceptable for our purposes. When PIC showed that agencies spanned multiple counties, we compared 2016 reserve spending between MTW and non-MTW agencies for the 2015 matched set. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and other interested parties. As a result, without a comprehensive framework—standard definitions, clear guidance on reporting requirements, and analysis plans—HUD cannot provide assurance that it is adequately monitoring how MTW activities affect tenants. The MTW demonstration is on the brink of significant expansion, but HUD does not yet have the performance of MTW agencies in relation to public housing occupancy and voucher unit utilization rates and program expenses, which could affect the number of tenants served. MTW agencies have accumulated relatively large reserves of voucher funding. The agencies are able to accumulate more reserves because their voucher funding formula differs from the formula used for the traditional voucher program. Some of these programs were provided through sponsor-based voucher programs administered by MTW agencies. As a result, MTW agencies have an incentive to expend their voucher funding to keep their budget utilization rate high. However, the voucher formula for MTW agencies, which is outlined in an attachment to each agency’s standard agreement, is generally based on the actual, per-unit costs in the year prior to the agency joining the MTW demonstration. Some of these programs were provided through sponsor-based voucher programs administered by partner agencies, which required coordination between the MTW agency and the partnering agencies. Limitations in HUD data make it difficult to more fully explain the differences that may affect the number of households served. In addition, until",
  " of household or residency status has been difficult for residents for several reasons, according to a Navajo-Hopi Legal Services Program representative and Navajo Nation chapter officials we interviewed. This report examines (1) ONHIR’s management of the eligibility and appeals processes and the status of these activities. As part of its administration of the New Lands, ONHIR’s regulations governing grazing of livestock on the New Lands are different from how grazing is regulated by BIA for other Indian trust land. In its comments on a draft of this report, ONHIR stated that the legal residence determination was complicated because many Navajos performed seasonal work and lived outside the Hopi Partitioned Lands for extended periods. However, according to BIA officials, BIA does not currently have the authority to conduct these activities, and BIA is not equipped to implement warranties. Post-move counseling. Another agency would need statutory authority to provide post-move counseling to the 52 clients who will remain under warranty after ONHIR’s proposed closure date of September 2018. Currently, ONHIR provides relocatees with post-move counseling during the 2-year warranty period. However, in its comments on a draft of this report, ONHIR stated that it has the capability in its electronic data system to search for warranty complaints. Post-move counseling. Another agency would need statutory authority to provide post-move counseling to the 52 clients who will remain under warranty after ONHIR’s proposed closure date of September 2018. In addition, ONHIR has the authority to provide post-move counseling to the 52 clients who will remain under warranty after ONHIR’s proposed closure date of September 2018. The majority of ONHIR’s management of the home building process and the status of these activities. We also conducted interviews with tribal government officials, including officials from the Navajo-Hopi Legal Services Program, the Navajo-Hopi Land Commission Office, and the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission. We also interviewed federal officials from the Navajo-Hopi Legal Services Program, the Navajo-Hopi Land Commission Office, and the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission. The Settlement Act authorized the partitioning of the surface of the joint use area and directed that it generally be split evenly between the tribes. The Navajo Nation has not reimbursed the general fund of the Treasury for the approximately $16 million appropriated to the fund, contrary to the statutory requirement to do so. While the Navajo Nation acknowledges its legal obligation to repay the Treasury, the tribe is seeking loan forgiveness because the Trust Fund’s purpose was to aid the relocatees and the tribe views such aid as an unfulfilled federal obligation, according to tribal officials. While ONHIR officials said that eligibility determination has been completed, the potential exists for further federal court appeals, and any future home-building activities may need to be assumed by a successor agency. The Settlement Act established a three-member commission, the Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, to administer the relocation program. The Settlement Act does not include provisions on the transfer of activities after ONHIR’s closure, and as described above several activities will remain past ONHIR’s planned closure date. Without legal direction For example, as part of control activities, management clearly documents all transactions and other significant events in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. However, as we reported, under BIA’s regulations for trust land it administers, revenue from leases is to be either paid directly to the tribe whose trust land is being leased or to BIA, which deposits the revenue in the tribe’s trust account that generally earns interest. BIA officials told us leases of trust land that provide for ONHIR’s remaining eligibility and appeals activities at that time, a successor agency will not have the institutional knowledge to follow and connect the information needed for determining eligibility and providing support for cases for which appeals were filed in federal court. 30. We recognize that ONHIR is not, and has never been, part of BIA. As we note in the report, the comparison to BIA is instructive because BIA administers the vast majority of Indian trust land. Although ONHIR has said they are working toward completing their tasks so the office can close by the end of fiscal year 2018, they acknowledge that not all activities will be complete by that time. As reported by the Interior Inspector General in 2016, ONHIR has collected and retained over $1 million in revenue from these leases of and surface use agreements for Navajo trust land. The officials also said they had an oral agreement to lease another property. ONHIR officials said they have used the revenue to aid relocation efforts by renovating facilities located on Navajo trust land ONHIR, which passed the Senate but was not enacted, according to ONHIR officials. Instead of directly requesting that the President make a determination for ONHIR to cease operations, ONHIR has been making plans to close through other means and transition",

As discussed previously, nearly all of the Federal Reserve’s regulatory flexibility analyses concluded a rule would not have a significant impact on small entities.

The Office of Advocacy’s regulatory analysis did not include a significant economic impact on small entities. The other two regulators we reviewed, CFTC and CFPB, plan to put procedures in place for section 610 reviews. According to CFTC officials, the agency has not conducted any section 610 reviews in at least the last 10 years. Specifically, for regulators other than the Federal Reserve, the final analyses for about half of the rules (11 of 22) noted receiving public comments on the initial analysis and nearly all of those described changes resulting from the comments. The Office of Advocacy did not describe or did not provide a description of the number of affected entities, the size of the economic impact, or the justification for the certification. As the Office of Advocacy’s guidance notes, agencies can coordinate preparation of regulatory flexibility analyses with any other analyses accompanying a rule. In addition, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act expands regulatory responsibilities for CFTC and SEC by establishing a new regulatory framework for swaps. The act authorizes CFTC to For example, in December 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) used the good-cause exception to publish a joint rule to adjust the asset-size thresholds for small entities, including for evaluating broad economic impacts on small entities, including for evaluating broad economic impacts of regulations in certification determinations and assessing alternatives that could minimize impact on small entities. According to the Federal Register notice, the agencies had no discretion on the computation or timing of the changes, which were based on a regulation that previously had been published for public comment before being finalized. In another rule published in October 2013, SEC made changes to the filer manual for its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System based on updates to the system and did not publish a proposed rule because the rule changes related solely to agency procedures or practice. According to CFPB officials, the majority of final CFPB rules issued during this time period without a proposed rule involved technical—and in many cases non- discretionary—adjustments of statutory or regulatory thresholds to account for inflation. While RFA requirements do not apply when an agency does not publish a proposed rule, OCC determined that the rule did not have an impact on small entities because it applied only to banks with $50 billion or more in assets, which are not small entities. The reasons cited for selecting the approach in the final rule generally reflected the actions taken by the agency to mitigate the rule’s economic impact on small entities. For the other rule, the Federal Reserve and OCC prepared separate initial analyses but published a joint final analysis that included considerations for determining whether a rule would have a significant economic impact on small entities.

Remittances to Fragile Countries: Treasury Should Assess Risks from Shifts to Non-Banking Channels. GAO-18-313. Washington, D.C.: March 8, 2018. Executive Order 13677 directed State to incorporate climate-resilience considerations into decision making by assessing climate-related risks to agency strategies, among other things. Subsequently, a State cable from September 2016 further explained that State would implement the executive order’s requirement by screening for climate risks, which was created in response to Executive Order 13677’s requirements to assess climate change risks to strategies, among other things. The effects of climate change in the Middle East and North Africa, including on its desert regions, may impact water access and compound migration and stability challenges, according to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). Over 60 percent of the population already experiences high or very high water stress, according to the World Bank. However, officials said that, with respect to the agency’s climate-related programming, its climate change adaptation programming was the most likely to include activities related to migration or displacement, although a broad swath of USAID development programming has the potential to build host country resilience. Officials stated that, to date, migration has not been a primary motivation for the agency’s climate-related or disaster assistance programming. However, officials said that, in a humanitarian crisis or under some economic conditions, development programming can reduce displacement or the pressure to migrate—such as by fostering greater resilience to drought or other adverse conditions. The United States is the only country in the Middle East and North Africa that has a large number of refugees. The United States is the only country in the Middle East and North Africa that has a large number of refugees. The United States is the only country in the Middle East and North Africa that has a large number of refugees. The United States is one example where decreased yields from agriculture and fisheries have contributed to migration to the country’s coastal cities, which face their own climate change challenges. The United States is one example where decreased yields from agriculture and fisheries have contributed to migration to the country’s coastal cities, which face their own climate change challenges. Bangladesh’s high population density and geography make the country susceptible to the effects of climate change, according to the UNEP and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, according to the World Bank, and others. Bangladesh’s coasts and river banks are vulnerable to sudden-onset events such as tropical cyclones and flooding. Cyclone Aila in 2009, for example, caused widespread flooding in the southern coastal areas of Bangladesh and impacted millions of people. For example, USAID has climate change adaptation activities, but to date migration has not been a focus of this programming. With the shift in priorities related to climate USAID officials stated that although disasters cause mainly temporary displacement, the relationship among humanitarian assistance, climate change, and migration is very complex and depends on both climatic and non-climatic factors. The previous State-USAID Joint Strategic Plan included a strategic goal on “promoting the transition to a low-emission, climate-resilient world” that proposed leading international actions to combat climate change. The current State-USAID Joint Strategic Plan does not have a climate change goal. State, USAID, and DOD were required by executive orders to assess climate change-related risks to their missions and, for State and USAID, to their strategies, among other things. In response to Executive Order 13653, which has since been revoked, the agencies completed adaptation plans (State/PRM, State/OES, and State’s Bureau of International Organization Affairs) and 7 regional bureau strategies. In response to Executive Order 13677, which has not been revoked, State and USAID developed processes for climate change risk assessments for their country and regional planning documents. Although these executive orders did not require a specific assessment of climate change as a risk to their strategic objectives, or to do so in a consistent manner, and thus may not have the information they would need to identify migration as a risk of climate change. By clearly documenting and providing guidance for these country strategies, State’s current guidance for these country strategies no longer mentions a climate change risk assessment and does not provide missions with information about the climate risk screening tool that can be used to conduct such an assessment. As such, missions are less likely to examine climate change as a risk to their strategic objectives, or to do so in a consistent manner, and thus may not have the information they would need to identify migration as a driver of migration",

The program is on track to meet its approved schedule and cost goals. The program is also projected to have an $83 million surplus in acquisition funding over this 5-year period, which NPPD officials anticipate will be less once the LCCE is completed. The program has improved integration with external systems. In January 2018, DHS guidance had received a $1.8 billion in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense (DHS) to date for full operational capability (FOC). The program’s O&M costs previously increased due to the DHS’s decision to prioritize acquisition funding in fiscal years 2019 and 2020 to procure the final 10 hulls and complete procurement of all 58 FRCs. The current MEA configuration is equipped with a separate TECS Modernization program. System operationally effective and suitable, but cybersecurity testing needed. CBP working to address and prevent major system outages. GAO last reported on this program in April 2017 (GAO-17-346SP). In July 2017, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership granted the program’s initial acquisition decision event (ADE) 3 approval, but required CBP to conduct follow-on operational test and evaluation (OT&E) before declaring full operational capability. DHS’s senior leaders are expected to modify the plans in accordance with their priorities and assessments, and they document their decisions in formal resource allocation decision memorandums. DHS submits the revised funding plans to the Office of Management and Budget, which uses them to inform the program had completed its ADE 2A. In January 2018, CBP officials announced that the program had completed its ADE 2A. In January 2018, CBP officials said the program plans to conduct ADE 2A in February or March 2018 and is aiming for ADE 2B for the biometric air solution in December 2018. In December 2015, Congress established an account to be used for the program because",
  "-day adjudication objective for at least three of four quarters for the fastest 90 percent of initial top secret cases.-day adjudication objective for at least three of four quarters for the fastest 90 percent of initial top secret cases in fiscal year 2012, only 43 percent met the objective for at least three of four quarters in fiscal year 2016. As of November 2017, these agencies had implemented 12 of those recommendations; we closed 4 due to the inaction of the responsible agencies; and 21 remained open. Examples of implemented recommendations include DOD’s issuance of adjudication guidance related to incomplete investigative reports, ODNI and OPM’s jointly proposed chapter and part to the Code of Federal Regulations clarifying, among other things, the need for a comprehensive review of all investigations and adjudications, and the need for a comprehensive review of all investigations and adjudications, and the need for a comprehensive review of all investigations and adjudications, and the need for a comprehensive review of all investigations and adjudications, and the need for a comprehensive review of all investigations and adjudications, and the need for a comprehensive review of all investigations and adjudications, and the need for a comprehensive review of all investigations and adjudications, and the need for a comprehensive review of all investigations and adjudications. In November 2017, we reported that the percent of executive branch agencies meeting established timeliness goals for completing periodic reinvestigations also decreased from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. However, according to DOD CIO officials, when the executive branch begins to use NBIS, NBIB will continue to rely on OPM legacy systems, or goals for increasing total investigator capacity. NBIB’s Key Performance Indicators report states that a “healthy” inventory of work, representing approximately 6 weeks of work and allowing NBIB to meet timeliness objectives, is around 180,000 pending investigations. NBIB officials stated that the bureau is part of OPM and is governed in a manner consistent with its other operational components. They also said that although the structure of NBIB is different from that of FIS, its general relationship with OPM and its leadership reporting chain are similar. In addition, OPM stated that the prior GAO and DOD data systems did not track complete revocation information; there was inconsistent implementation of the requirements in the governing executive orders by DHS, DOD, and some of the Director of OPM, and there was limited oversight over the revocation process, among other things. As we reported when placing DOD’s personnel security clearance program on the high-risk list, problems related to backlogs and the resulting delays in determining clearance eligibility and issuing initial clearances can result in millions of dollars of additional costs to the federal government, longer periods of time needed to complete national security-related contracts, and the extent to which reciprocity is granted government-wide was unknown. Fourth, in November 2017, we reported that the personnel security clearance process and reform efforts are governed by various executive orders. Key executive orders affecting personnel security clearance reform include Executive Orders 12968, 13467, 13741, and 13764, which, among other things, provide definitions, processes, responsibilities, and authorities related to eligibility for access to classified information, suitability and fitness for government employment, and security clearance reform. Aspects of the reform effort covered by the Executive Investigations Services, LLC (USIS). According to NBIB, OPM was responsible for about 65 percent of the contractor workload. In addition, OPM’s policy requires that scheduled completion dates be included in the plan. The policy also requires a system’s Information System Security Officer to develop an evidence-based review of the timeliness objectives for completing initial secret and initial top secret security clearances, and take action to adjust the objectives if appropriate, ODNI stated that it is premature to revise the existing timeliness goals until NBIB’s backlog is resolved. According to PAC Program Management Office officials, they have continued to track the status of these milestones internally, and almost half of the initiatives—16 of 33—were listed as complete as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. These initiatives include the establishment of a Federal Background Investigations Liaison Office within NBIB to oversee and resolve issues between federal, state, and local law enforcement entities when collecting criminal history record information for background investigations, and developing plans to implement improved investigator and adjudicator training. Strategic framework. The PAC has issued three documents that serve as its updated strategic framework for the next 5 years. In July 2016, as this report was in its final stages, Congress passed a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which includes a provision that, among other things, would authorize DOD to conduct its own background investigations. It would also require DOD to begin carrying out the implementation plan developed in response to section 951 by October 1, 2020. The standards were developed through an interagency effort chaired by ODNI, OPM, and DOD. These standards define complete investigations as those in which all required to",
  ". As discussed previously, CFPB’s proposed changes to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, which are intended to reduce the regulatory burden on banks and credit unions. CFPB’s proposed changes to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, which are intended to reduce the regulatory burden on banks and credit unions, are outside of their core competencies. CFPB staff told us that it is too early to definitively identify what impact TRID has had on borrowers’ understanding of mortgage terms, but told us that some information they have seen indicated that it has been helpful. CFPB staff acknowledged that HMDA data collection and reporting may be time consuming, and said they have taken steps to reduce the associated burdens for community banks and credit unions. As we reported in 2012, federal regulators, state regulatory associations, and industry associations collectively identified provisions within 7 of the act’s 16 titles that they expected to affect community banks and credit unions. The provisions they identified as likely to affect community banks and credit unions. The provisions they identified as likely to affect community banks and credit unions included some of the act’s mortgage reforms, such as those requiring institutions to ensure that a consumer obtaining a residential mortgage loan has the reasonable ability to repay the loan at the time the loan is consummated; comply with a new CFPB rule that combines two different mortgage loan disclosures that had been required by the Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974; and ensure that property appraisers are sufficiently independent. In addition, several professional appraiser associations argued that raising the threshold could undermine the safety and soundness of lenders and diminish consumer protection for mortgage products. These commenters argued that increasing the thresholds could encourage banks to neglect collateral risk-management responsibilities. In response, in July 2017, the regulators proposed raising the threshold for when an appraisal is required from $250,000 to $400,000 for commercial real estate loans. In addition, it has not indicated the extent to which it will coordinate the reviews with the federal depository institution regulators as part of the EGRPRA process. In addition, CFPB has not indicated the extent to which it will coordinate the reviews with the federal depository institution regulators as part of the EGRPRA process. In addition, CFPB has not indicated the extent to which it will coordinate the reviews with the federal depository institution regulators as part of the EGRPRA process. In January 2013, CFPB also included exemptions for some institutions in a rule related to originating loans that meet certain characteristics—known as qualified mortgages—in order for the institutions to receive certain liability protections if the loans later go into default. In that same month, non- community banks had about $390 billion outstanding in business loans under $1 million representing 5 percent of their total lending. Credit unions also noted that accessing beneficial ownership information about companies can be difficult, and that entities that issue business licenses or tax identification numbers could perform this task more easily than financial institutions. In some of our focus groups, and in some comment letters that we reviewed that community banks and credit unions we spoke with reported may not be representative of the experiences of other lenders. A preliminary CFPB analysis of industry-published mortgage closing data found that, FDIC, and OCC reviewed, evaluated, and summarized more than 200 comment letters and numerous oral comments they received. For interagency regulations that received numerous comments, such as those relating to capital and BSA/AML requirements, the comment letters for each were provided to staff of one of the three regulators or to previously established interagency working groups to conduct the initial assessments. The regulators’ comment assessments also included reviews by each agency’s subject-matter experts, who prepared draft summaries of the concerns and proposed agency responses for each of the rules that received comments. According to CFPB staff, their role in the most recent EGRPRA process was very limited. CFPB staff told us they had no role in assessing the public comments received for purposes of the final 2017 EGRPRA report. According to one bank regulator, the bank regulators did not share non- mortgage regulation-related letters with CFPB staff because those comment letters did not involve CFPB regulations. In addition to less formal steps, such as contacting a regional office, each of the four regulators have an ombudsman office to which institutions can submit complaints or concerns about examination findings. Participants in one focus group noted that CFPB’s final rule implementing TRID was very long—the rule available on CFPB’s website is more than 1,800 pages including the rule’s preamble. In addition to less formal steps, such as contacting a regional office, each of the four regulators have an ombudsman office to which institutions can submit complaints or concerns about examination findings. In the final rule implementing the new requirements, CFPB also expanded the types of loans on which some institutions must report HMDA data to include",
  "the criminal violations and the use of DHS’s Automated Biometric Identification System to check for both criminal and immigration violations. According to TSA officials in May 2017, they planned to update the Systems Engineering Life Cycle Tailoring Plan to reflect the revised governance framework, but they did not have a specific time frame for completing the revision. However, it is unclear how the acceleration of the development and implementation of these functions will impact the delivery of the other planned functionality. Accordingly, the OIG recommended that TSA establish measurable and comparable criteria to use in evaluating and selecting the best criminal and immigration recurrent vetting option, and TSA concurred with this recommendation. DHS officials stated that they plan to conduct biannual oversight reviews of the five Agile pilot programs (including TIM), instead of the annual reviews that are typically conducted for traditional waterfall development programs. According to the officials, the purpose of moving to biannual reviews is to better ensure cost, schedule, and performance remain on track for these Agile programs. However, officials in the Office of the Chief Technology Officer stated that DHS- level Agile governance and oversight policies and procedures have not been revised to reflect this new oversight approach. These recommendations to DHS are summarized in appendix I. These recommendations to DHS are summarized in appendix I. These recommendations to DHS are summarized in appendix I. We are making the following 14 recommendations to DHS: The TSA Administrator should ensure that the TIM program management office establishes and implements specific time frames for determining key strategic implementation details, including how the program will transition from the current state to the new state. The TSA Administrator should ensure that the TIM program management office establishes and implements specific time frames for determining key strategic implementation details, including how the program will transition from the current to the new state. In response to our concerns, program officials stated that after they determine how they will adjust to incorporate the Acquisition Review Board’s recent acceleration request, they will determine the details of how the program will achieve the desired final state. (Recommendation 2) The TSA Administrator should ensure that the TIM program management office establishes new time frames for determining key implementation details, including how it will transition the program from its current state to an interim state and to the final state, the TIM program has been delayed in implementing other steps. According to leading practices and guidance, the TIM program has been delayed in implementing other steps. According to leading practices, to ensure effective program oversight and governance changes, and then documents and implements associated changes, the program continues to plan as though it is undergoing annual oversight reviews, versus biannual reviews. As of early May 2017, officials in the Office of the Chief Technology Officer were also in the process of drafting guidance for Agile programs to use for collecting and reporting on performance metrics, but did not know when this guidance will be finalized. TSA’s security threat assessments support over 30 credentialing programs in the maritime, surface, and aviation transportation segments. The largest programs include the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program for maritime workers, Hazardous Materials Endorsement program for commercially licensed drivers, the Aviation Worker program, and TSA Pre® for travelers at airport checkpoints. According to leading practices, effective According to TIM officials, the program’s methodology for measuring velocity was not consistent and was calculated differently each time. For example, table 5 shows three different numbers that were to represent the collective velocity across the development teams, and that officials reported to program management after the deployment of the first software release. While there was less variation in the velocity data reported after the second software release, discrepancies were still present. While the program experienced delays in setting up its production environment, officials recently took actions to address these delays. Specifically, the program was expected to have a new production environment available at the TSA Colorado Springs Operations Center by March 2017; however, it was delayed until May 2017. Additionally, while migration of the TIM system to the new hosting environments was planned to occur by September 2017, it has been delayed. These delays have contributed, in part, to delays in other aspects of the program, including the execution of the cybersecurity vulnerability assessment, as well as delays in the implementation of automated testing and deployment tools (discussed later in this report). In response to these delays, program officials recently established a revised schedule in May 2017 for setting up the new environments by December 2017. This training was tailored based on different roles, such as Agile practitioner, program manager or product owner, and scrum master. Officials also stated that they expected this effort to be completed by 2018. According to leading practices and guidance, technology decisions should seek to enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively and to avoid vendor lock-in by, for example, using open source solutions. As such, adjudicators are to continue to complete and close any security threat assessment cases opened in the legacy system even after the new system is deployed. This backlog should be maintained so that the program can ensure it is always on track to meet the requirements of the program. In response, the TSA Administrator should ensure that the program is",

For example, FDIC, OCC, and the Federal Reserve participate in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism Experts Group. We conducted interviews with representatives of the Southwest border region. We conducted interviews with representatives from various border stakeholders including economic development specialists, industry and trade organizations that focus on border trade and commerce, as well as chamber of commerce and municipal officials representing border communities. We reviewed recent articles on the effects of account terminations and branch closures on communities as well as research organization, industry, and government reports. Our survey results and discussions with Southwest border bank representatives are consistent with what a senior Treasury official identified in a 2015 speech as causing correspondent banking and money services business account terminations. The speech noted that a number of interrelated factors may be resulting in the terminations, but that the most frequently mentioned reason related to efforts to comply with AML and terrorist financing requirements. In particular, banks raised concerns about (1) the cost of complying with AML and terrorist financing regulations, (2) uncertainty about supervisors’ expectations regarding what is appropriate due diligence, and (3) the nature of the enforcement and supervisory response if they get it wrong.

The Department of Homeland Security has made progress toward implementing the strategy’s stated priorities. The Department of Homeland Security has made progress toward implementing the strategy’s stated priorities. In response to our recommendation, in October 2015, the Director of OMB and the Federal Chief Information Officer, issued a Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal Civilian Government. The plan directed a series of actions to improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and threats, enhance protections of government assets and information, and further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to ensure readiness and resilience when incidents inevitably occur. The plan also identified key milestones for implementing government-wide cybersecurity initiatives, addressing weaknesses in their information systems and responding to cyber incidents. Further, we reported that, in some cases, DOD guidance provides specific details on other types of Defense Support of Civil Authorities-related responses, such as assigning roles and responsibilities for fire or emergency services support and medical support, but does not provide the same level of detail or assign roles and responsibilities for cyber support. However, as of August 2018, eight of these recommendations had not been implemented. DHS had been challenged in measuring how the NCCIC was performing its functions in accordance with mandated implementing principles. In February 2017, we reported that DHS had not ensured that the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) had fully satisfied all intended system objectives related to intrusion detection and prevention capabilities and the intrusion assessment plan. As such, it is important that federal agencies take action to address the security risks related to Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out technology that could adversely affect DOD missions. These risks came from information broadcast by the system itself, as well as from potential vulnerabilities to electronic warfare- and cyber-attacks, and from the potential divestment of secondary-surveillance radars. However, DOD and FAA had not approved any solutions to address the risks they identified to the system. In January 2016, we reported that DHS had not ensured that the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) had fully satisfied all intended system objectives related to intrusion detection and prevention, information sharing, and analytics. In addition, in February 2017, we reported that the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center’s (NCCIC) functions were not being performed in adherence with the principles set forth in federal laws. We noted that, although NCCIC was sharing information about cyber threats in the way it should, the center did not have metrics to measure that the information was timely, relevant and actionable, as prescribed by law. For more information on this action area, see appendix VI. In January 2016, we reported that critical systems and other vehicle systems, such as a Bluetooth connection, should be separate in-vehicle networks so they could not communicate or interfere with one another.

For example, these agencies did not always identify a role for the CISO in ensuring that security controls are periodically tested; procedures are in place for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; or contingency plans and procedures for agency information systems are in place. In January 2016, we reported that the CISOs’ ability to effectively oversee these agencies’ information security activities can be limited. In addition, we reported that the system’s intrusion prevention capability was limited and its information-sharing capability was not fully developed. To assist CISOs in carrying out their responsibilities and better define their roles, we made a total of 34 recommendations to OMB and 13 agencies in our review. Agency responses to the recommendations varied; as of August 2018, 18 of the 34 recommendations had not been implemented. Presidential Policy Directive-41 sets forth principles governing the federal government’s response to any cyber incident, whether involving government or private sector entities. According to the directive, federal agencies shall undertake three concurrent lines of effort when responding to any cyber incident: threat response; asset response; and intelligence support and related activities. In addition, when a federal agency is an affected entity, it shall undertake a fourth concurrent line of effort to manage the effects of the cyber incident. In July 2017, we reported that, based on a review of a sample of organizations within the Department of State’s telecommunications supply chain, we were able to identify instances in which device manufacturers, software developers and contractor support were reported to be headquartered in a leading cyber-threat nation.

  " of the overall human capital strategy to ensure effective workforce planning. According to Marine Corps officials, they have not taken additional steps to address workforce challenges in part because inventories of UAS operators and officers have grown and squadrons have generally attained readiness goals and accomplished their deployment missions despite personnel shortages. The Navy and the Marine Corps have updated the life cycle cost estimate for the RQ-21 Blackjack to account for changing assumptions, such as the expected usage rate of spare parts for system repairs, but not for additional Marine Corps personnel that squadrons have reportedly needed for deployments. Without exploring these or other human capital flexibilities to improve morale and career satisfaction and maximize operators’ availability to squadrons, the Marine Corps may face continued challenges in meeting personnel requirements and the growing demands of expanding operations and increasing UAS inventories. According to Navy officials, the Navy and the Marine Corps are in the process of rapidly growing their portfolios of unmanned systems, but have not evaluated the use of alternative workforces—specifically the use of federal civilian employees and private sector contractors as unmanned system operators. According to officials from the Navy Manpower Analysis Center, we did not find evidence that the Navy has taken or planned related steps such as determining whether future reductions to personnel requirements could be accomplished, and any associated cost savings, or benefits to UAS operations if policies were further updated. According to Navy officials, the additional personnel requirements for the Navy associated with the establishment of Triton squadrons are offset by realignments of the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force, including the retirement of the P-3 Orion aircraft and reduction of associated personnel requirements. The Navy has taken or planned related steps such as determining whether future reductions to personnel requirements could be accomplished, and any associated cost savings, or benefits to UAS operations if policies were further updated. According to DOD Instruction 1100.22, the initial steps in planning for personnel requirements include determining categories of eligible personnel (e.g., military servicemembers, federal civilian employees, or private sector contractors). These determinations are based on the use of alternative workforces—specifically the use of UAS officers and short periods of time in which operators are trained and available to UAS squadrons before their contract or squadron assignment ends. Results of a 2015 Marine Corps survey of UAS officers showed that about 65 percent of captains and first lieutenants who responded were dissatisfied with their career and about 75 percent of that group cited low job satisfaction as influencing their decision to leave the Marine Corps. UAS officers and enlisted operators in all eight discussion groups we held told us about factors that enhance their morale, including the opportunities to learn and to shape their community and their positive deployment experiences, but they also discussed factors that negatively affect their job satisfaction. UAS operators in all enlisted groups cited the frequency of personnel turnover in the squadron as a source of frustration in developing and retaining expertise with the RQ-21 Blackjack. Officers told us they feel like a lower tier priority in Marine Corps aviation for reasons ranging from the lack of a uniform insignia device akin to those awarded to manned aircraft pilots (i.e., pilot (Recommendation 6) The Secretary of the Navy and the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs should clarify the primary differences between the two. The Secretary of the Navy and the Deputy Commandant for Aviation, should prioritize continued efforts to fully evaluate policies for operating and maintaining UAS of different sizes and capabilities, such as group 3 UAS—to include establishing completion time frames, determining whether reductions to personnel requirements could be accomplished, and identifying any associated cost savings and the benefits to the UAS squadrons’ ability to complete missions. However, both services face challenges in ensuring that there are sufficient UAS operators to meet personnel requirements. For fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the Marine Corps was substantially short of captains, majors, and lieutenant colonels (i.e., O3, O4, and O5 pay grades) to serve as UAS officers. The Navy plans to attain initial operational capability with the Mine Countermeasures USVs in fiscal year 2021. The Chief of Naval Personnel and the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs should assess civilian supply, demand, and wages in the commercial drone industry and use the results to inform retention approaches, including the use of special and incentive pays for UAS operators. (Recommendation 9) The Deputy Commandant for Aviation and the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs should examine the use of additional human capital flexibilities that could improve the career satisfaction and retention of experienced UAS operators and maximize their availability to squadrons. An air crew consists of two personnel: one air vehicle operator and one mission payload operator. There is no additive personnel requirement associated with operators of the MQ-8 Fire Scout because these personnel already reside within existing expeditionary MH-60 helicopter squadron detachments. This report addresses the extent to which the Navy and the Marine Corps have (1) evaluated workforce alternatives for their unmanned system operators, including the use of federal civilian employees and private sector operators.

  "FEMA’s Office of Chief Information Security Officer, and FEMA’s Acting Chief Information Security Officer, regarding their efforts to assess, document, and review security controls for GMM. We found this initial estimate to be reliable because it fully or substantially addressed all the characteristics associated with a reliable cost estimate. For example, the program utilized NIST guidance to select standard controls for a system categorized with a moderate-impact security level. These control areas include, for example, access controls, risk assessment, incident response, identification and authentication, and configuration management. These control areas include, for example, access controls, risk assessment, incident response, identification and authentication, and configuration management. Further, the program documented its planned actions to implement each control in its System Security Plan for the engineering and test environment. For example, the program conducted a risk assessment and sensitivity analysis, and DHS conducted an independent assessment of the cost estimate to validate the accuracy and credibility of the cost estimate. However, key assumptions that FEMA made about the program’s automated security controls management tool, we interviewed knowledgeable officials about the quality control procedures used by the program to assure accuracy and completeness of the data. We also documented target grants management business process workflows for 18 of the 19 business functions that were notionally planned to be developed and deployed in the AFG pilot by December 2018. However, the program experienced delays in developing the AFG pilot (discussed later in this report) and, thus, deferred defining the remaining business function until the program gets closer to developing that function, which is now planned for August 2019. However, in May 2017, the program made changes to the technical approach, meaning that GMM would implement a software-as-a-service model, meaning that FEMA would implement a software-as-a-service model, meaning that FEMA would rely on a service provider to deliver software applications and the underlying infrastructure to run them. However, in December 2017, the program instead decided to implement an infrastructure-as-a-service model, meaning that FEMA would develop and deploy its own software application and the need for crosscutting of grant programs. In April 2016, the DHS OIG and we have previously highlighted challenges with FEMA’s past attempts to modernize its grant management systems. In addition, FEMA established measurable business performance goals for GMM that are aimed at addressing problem areas and improving grants management processes. Specifically, the agency established 14 business performance goals for GMM that are aimed at addressing problem areas and improving grants management processes. Specifically, the agency established 14 business performance goals and associated thresholds in an October 2017 acquisition program baseline addendum, as well as 126 performance metrics for all 43 of the target grants management business functions in its March 2017 test and evaluation master plan. This decision was made after learning from the Agile development team that the infrastructure-as-a-service model would allow GMM to develop the system in a more flexible environment. Additionally, the 14 business performance goals are intended to represent essential outcomes that will indicate whether GMM has successfully met critical, business-focused mission needs. In addition, FEMA had begun planning for business process reengineering; however, it had not finalized plans for transitioning users to the new business processes. Further, while GMM took steps to establish clearly defined and prioritized IT requirements, key requirements were not always However, despite these actions, the officials were unable to provide time frames for completing the organizational change management plan or the additional actions. Until the plan and actions are complete, the program lacks assurance that it will have sufficient support among stakeholders for the reengineered processes. Additionally, the Information System Security Officer is to review each planned user story and, if it is determined that the proposed changes may impact the integrity of the authorization, the Information System Security Officer is to work with the development team to begin the process of updating the system authorization. Finally, GMM uses automated tools to document the frequency in which security controls are assessed and to ensure that required scanning data are received by FEMA for reporting purposes. In addition, until recently, GMM is in the process of removing one of its key performance parameters in the acquisition program baseline related to financial systems interoperability and timeliness of data exchanged. In May 2017, DHS approved the acquisition program baseline for GMM. The baseline estimated the total lifecycle costs to be about $251 million, initial operational capability to be achieved by September 2019, and full operational capability to be achieved by September 2020. FEMA intends to develop and deploy its own software applications for GMM using a combination of commercial-off-the-shelf software, open source software, and custom developed code. The agency plans to rely on an Agile software development approach. According to FEMA planning documentation, the agency plans to fully deliver GMM by September 2020. This office is responsible for directing the day-to-day operations and ensuring completion of GMM program goals and objectives. The program office resides within the Office of Response and Recovery, which is headed by an Associate Administrator who reports to the FEMA planned to the",
  ", searches the state’s repositories and NICS to identify any criminal history records or prohibitions. OSP’s Firearms Instant Check System (FICS) unit conducts criminal background checks to determine the eligibility of individuals attempting to transfer or purchase a firearm. According to a county prosecutor, a key component of successful prosecutions is a willing Commonwealth Attorney because charging decisions are at their discretion. In fiscal year 2017, ATF’s DENI Branch referred 1,889 delayed denial cases to our six selected field divisions—which field divisions are required to investigate— and 5,435 standard denials cases, which they are to consider for further investigation. EOUSA officials said that the number of prosecutions of firearms denials can be low, particularly in standard denial cases. The number of prosecutions of firearms denials can be low, particularly in standard denial cases where the subject did not obtain a firearm, and because of the high volume of cases where the subject did not obtain a firearm, which they are to consider for further investigation. EOUSA officials said that the number of prosecutions of firearms denials can be low, particularly in standard denial cases where the subject did not obtain a firearm, and because of the high volume of cases where the subject did not obtain a firearm, which they are to consider for further investigation. EOUSA officials said that the number of prosecutions of firearms denials can be low, particularly in standard denial cases where the system worked and the subject did not obtain a firearm, and because of the priority often given to other cases involving gun violence. According to officials from our six selected ATF field divisions, standard denial referrals may meet USAOs criteria and be referred to a field division for investigation, but almost always do not have prosecutive merit based on coordination with prosecutors. Cases in which the recipient is qualified to complete the transfer, and has the recipient complete the form for transfer of a firearm, only that the prohibited individual is intentionally in possession of a firearm. For instance, generally, to obtain a conviction for a felon in possession of a firearm, the prosecution must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had previously been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than 1 year; the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm; and the firearm previously passed in interstate commerce. However, officials from our six selected field divisions said that USAOs generally do not accept standard denials that only involve a violation related to falsified information. The officials also said that as long as a firearm is recovered from the prohibited person and the person is cooperative, ATF is unlikely to refer delayed denial investigations to USAOs for prosecution. While officials from all six selected field divisions said that investigating the increasing number of denial cases can be time-intensive and require use of their limited resources. While the investigation of standard denials also can take time, officials from our six selected field divisions said they have greater discretion over whether or not to investigate these investigations. Among other things, EOUSA provides guidance, management direction, and oversight to USAOs. The types of denial cases that are referred for investigation in Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia are determined in part by the priorities the states have set for such referrals. For Oregon and Pennsylvania, which investigate all According to Oregon troopers, denial investigations that are recommended for prosecution often involve convictions for felonies, misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, and restraining orders. The troopers said that while their state does not investigate or prosecute firearms denials, their state may take other actions following a denial. Or. Rev. Stat. § 166.418 Improperly transferring a firearm. Or. Rev. Stat. § 166.425 Unlawfully purchasing a firearm. Or. Rev. Stat. § 166.435 Firearm transfers by unlicensed persons; requirements; exceptions; penalties. Or. Rev. Stat. § 166.470 Limitations and conditions for sales of firearms. Generally, Oregon’s Constitution requires the election by districts of a sufficient number of prosecuting attorneys (District Attorneys), who are the law officers of the state, and of the counties within their respective districts, and are to perform duties pertaining to the administration of law. The District Attorney responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, representing the district in felony prosecutions, misdemeanor prosecutions, grand jury proceedings, mental commitment hearings, family abuse prevention hearings, and juvenile delinquency hearings. After a trooper completes an investigation, they submit a report to the District Attorney’s office. When a trooper completes an investigation, they submit a report to the District Attorney’s office. When a case is not prosecuted, a rejection memo is provided to the trooper that submitted the report. From 2011 through 2017, prohibited persons convicted of a felony was the most common category among firearm denials, followed by individuals on probation, individuals convicted of a violent misdemeanor in the previous 4 years, and wanted persons. The two largest prohibiting categories, convicted felons and individuals on probation, were the most common categories of firearms denials. The two largest categories, convicted felons and individuals on probation, were the most likely to the",
  " and transcripts related to ticketing issues. We examined summary-level information about each piece of literature, and from this review, identified articles that were germane to our report. We generally focused on articles from 2009 and later. We identified additional articles and reports through citations in literature we reviewed and from expert recommendations. For the articles we used to cite empirical findings or to support arguments on advantages and disadvantages of selected resale restrictions or disclosure requirements, we conducted a methodology and soundness review. Some consumer advocates, state officials, and event organizers believe that brokers unfairly use this advantage to obtain tickets from the primary market, which restricts ordinary consumers from buying tickets at face value. The level of fees in the secondary market is limited to the primary market, which is limited to the primary market. The level of fees in the secondary market is limited to the primary market, which is limited to the primary market. The level of fees in the secondary market is limited to the primary market. The level of fees in the secondary market might also be affected by partnerships between the primary and secondary ticket seller. Primary ticketing companies sometimes offer resale options or use of designated resale exchanges (discussed below). The American Antitrust Institute has expressed the view that these relationships can reduce inventory for rival secondary sellers and in turn, can result in higher fees, as the primary ticket seller essentially has a monopoly over both markets. The level of fees in the secondary market might also be affected by partnerships between the primary and secondary ticket seller. The level of fees in the secondary market might also be affected by partnerships between the primary and secondary ticket seller. Primary ticketing companies sometimes offer resale options or use of designated resale exchanges (discussed below). In addition, some event organizers and primary ticket sellers have expressed frustration that up-front disclosure of fees could be challenging because a ticket’s fee is not stable—for example, the fee can change based on price fluctuations, different delivery methods, and the use of promotion codes. Some professional brokers use software programs known as bots to purchase large numbers of tickets very quickly. When tickets first go on sale, bots can complete multiple simultaneous searches of the primary ticket seller’s website, perhaps because the event has not yet gone on sale. Brokers may sell speculative tickets. All 17 of the white label webpages we reviewed disclosed on their landing page and check-out page that they were not associated with the venue and were resale prices. All 17 of the white label webpages we reviewed disclosed on their landing page and check-out page that they were not associated with the venue and were resale sites whose prices may be above face value. However, this information was presented in a small font or in an inconspicuous location (not near the top of the page) for the landing page of 7 of these webpages, as well as for the check-out page of 12 of the 17 webpages. Ticket prices were higher than other resale sites. The ticket price charged for the events we reviewed on the white-label sites had an average markup of about 180 percent over the primary market price. By comparison, other ticket resale websites we reviewed had an average markup of 74 percent. We asked if we would have difficulty using the ticket because the venue’s or ticket seller’s website stated that only the original buyer could use the ticket, with one website noting that picture identification might be required for entry. Customer service representatives of all three exchanges told us that despite the purported restrictions, we would be able to use the ticket to gain entry to the venue. In the concert industry, it is unclear how often artists and event organizers sell tickets directly through the secondary market. Any formal agreements would be in business-confidential contracts, according to industry representatives, and artists may be concerned about disclosing them for fear of appearing to profit from high resale prices. According to industry representatives, fraudulent ticketing is rare on secondary market exchanges, in part because the exchanges can take action against sellers of fraudulent tickets, such as fining them or banning them from future sales. The National Association of Ticket Brokers requires its members to have a policy to reimburse consumers for fraudulent tickets. Two secondary market participants told us the most common fraudulent activity they must address is credit card fraud by buyers rather than invalid tickets posted by sellers. Designated resale exchanges are resale platforms that are linked to the primary ticket seller. They are most commonly used in major league sports. Proponents of nontransferable tickets, which include a large primary ticket seller and some event organizers and well-known artists, have argued they are an important tool that makes it harder for brokers to resell tickets for profit. We identified one empirical study on the effects of nontransferable tickets on resale transactions. Representatives of one secondary market company told us of two cases in which representatives of popular artists approached his company about selling blocks of tickets for upcoming tours. Ticket resale prices can be significantly higher than primary market prices and brokers account for most sales on major ticket exchanges. A 2017 law",
  "s leadership of the Interagency Committee on Standards Policy (ICSP) for review: Outcomes and Accountability: Have short-term and long-term outcomes been clearly defined? Is there a way to track and monitor their progress? NIST takes a variety of steps to identify agency stakeholders’ measurement-service and documentary-standards needs, has procedures to support the prioritization of measurement services and standards activities, and has developed mechanisms for communicating with stakeholders. While these steps help NIST address challenges to identifying and prioritizing needs and communicating with stakeholders, some aspects of these efforts do not fully align with federal guidance or NIST policy. Identifying measurement-service and documentary-standards needs: NIST identifies stakeholders’ measurement-service or documentary-standards needs. Further, NIST’s ability to ensure participation is appropriately prioritized across the many documentary-standards development activities. In addition, NIST’s ability to ensure that NIST’s measurement-service and documentary-standards development activities are consistent with NIST’s policy, and NIST’s ability to ensure compliance with Circular A-119. NIST officials said that when NIST has become aware of concerns about U.S. representation at an international standards activity within a federal government area of responsibility, it has led efforts to ensure adequate representation in those activities. For example, according to NIST officials, NIST: Worked with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to help identify another organization to represent U.S. interests in a standards activity that affected U.S. intellectual property after the original organization decided not to continue participating. NIST officials said that when NIST has become aware of concerns about U.S. representation at an international standards activity within a federal government area of responsibility, it has led efforts to ensure adequate representation in those activities.

For example, according to NIST officials, NIST: Worked with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to help identify another organization to represent U.S. interests in a standards activity that affected U.S. intellectual property after the original organization decided not to continue participating. OMB Circular A-119 and the ICSP charter specify that the ICSP may obtain information on international standards activities in which U.S. industry representation is needed. NIST officials said that developing new documentary standards can take from a year and a half up to a decade to complete, and accordingly, NIST considers what the standards industry is likely to need in the next 1 to 5 years. According to NIST officials, determining the time spent on documentary standards can be difficult. Specifically, staff participate in standards development within their areas of expertise and often this work is closely related to their research activities. While some staff may have expertise that is closely linked to a small number of SDOs and activities, others may have expertise in foundational technologies that have relevance to numerous activities. Further, a participant in one focus group and two agency standards executives we interviewed stated that standards need to be revised from time to time. NIST’s role in the ICSP is to facilitate interagency coordination on standards activities. NIST’s role in the ICSP is to facilitate interagency coordination on standards activities. Without additional guidance regarding the roles and responsibilities of the ICSP and its members, NIST cannot be assured that decisions on when to participate in such activities are made consistently. For example, two agency standards executives said that questions and suggestions raised by agencies at the ICSP led to coordination with other agencies on a standards area of mutual interest. According to NIST officials, interagency coordination also occurs through the National Science and Technology Council’s committees and subcommittees. Further, individual documentary standards areas may have additional interagency coordination. For instance, NIST has a role, delegated by the Secretary of Commerce, to ensure U.S. interests are adequately represented at private international standards organizations but does not currently have a mechanism to use the process under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 to identify or respond to circumstances when U.S. interests in all relevant international standards activities. Further, NIST has previously taken action in some cases in international standards activities within a federal government area of responsibility, as described above. Additionally, the ongoing contacts between NIST and SDOs and staff participation in standards activities can help NIST keep adequately informed on international standards activities. Additionally, NIST could develop a legislative proposal that allows NIST to ensure adequate U.S. participation in international standards activities while addressing any concerns. NIST has processes to guide decision-making about measurement services; this guidance helps address the challenges focus group participants identified given that NIST cannot address all needs. Before choosing to develop a new measurement service, such as a new standard reference material or",

FSIS inspectors and workers in meat and poultry plants are exposed to antimicrobial chemicals every day, as they are commonly used during all work shifts, both on animal and bird carcasses and on work surfaces and machinery. In general, the potential for chemical exposure is greater for plant workers than for FSIS inspectors. In general, the potential for chemical exposure is greater for plant workers than for FSIS inspectors. According to officials we spoke with at various plants, plant workers handle these chemicals by receiving shipments, opening containers, and filling machines with the chemical, among other ways, while FSIS inspectors are generally not present at various times that workers are using the chemical, most notably, when the plant is being cleaned between shifts. OSHA officials told us they developed such training for FSIS in the mid to late 1990s, but according to FSIS officials the course was too excessive and burdensome for FSIS inspectors. Antimicrobials may be sprayed directly on meat or poultry, or may be used to clean machinery. FSIS officials and worker advocates have raised worker safety concerns about peracetic acid, an antimicrobial chemical that is being used by the meat and poultry industry for both of these purposes. According to OSHA officials, they will try to schedule an interview off-site if an employee expresses discomfort or if a union arranges it. Officials stated that they do not automatically offer off- site interviews to each employee; rather, inspectors should consult with their Area Directors before offering to conduct an interview. Workers might not volunteer access information to OSHA. Workers might not volunteer access information to OSHA. Our work identified a mismatch between the concerns we heard from workers and the problems reported by OSHA.

Officials said that requiring inspectors to investigate bathroom access, such as by selectively querying workers based on criteria determined by the agency. This course—which is now available only on CD—is required for inspectors who do not work on the line and is optional for those who do. OSHA requires inspectors at poultry plants to consistently investigate other specific hazards, such as ergonomics hazards, and that interviewing workers on the production line may be advantageous in some cases, as it allows workers to clarify some uncertainties by showing the inspector how their work is done. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should use quality information to achieve their In a 2014 hazard alert letter to another poultry plant, OSHA identified practices that it determined were contrary to good medical practice for managing work-related MSDs, including prolonged treatment by nursing station staff without referral to a physician. The letter included one example in which a worker made over 90 visits to the nursing station before referral to a physician. The letter included one example in which a worker made over 90 visits to the nursing station before referral to a physician. Meat and poultry workers we interviewed in all five states reported problems with on-site medical care; for example, workers said their supervisor or plant nurse may not take appropriate steps when a worker is injured or ill, such as not referring the worker to a doctor or failing to move the worker to a different work station on the line. As discussed above, FSIS has not comprehensively tracked its compliance assistance activities in the past, but officials told us the agency launched a database module that started tracking these activities in fiscal year 2017. Recent examples of OSHA’s compliance assistance efforts related to meat and poultry plants include the following: OSHA officials stated that in fiscal years 2011-2015, states provided 558 on-site consultation visits, largely funded by OSHA, along with increases in several types of unprogrammed inspections in 2010-2015.

  ", GAO-13-441 (Washington, D.C.: May 31, 2013)., VA did not immediately improve the timeliness of veterans’ Choice Program care because veterans still had to wait for as long as it took the VAMCs to send their referrals to the TPAs and for TPAs to return them before the VAMCs could proceed with arranging care through Choice Program provider agreements. The results of these two VAMC scheduling pilots are particularly relevant, given that VA’s RFP, as amended, for its planned consolidated community care program indicates that VAMCs—rather than TPAs—will carry out community care appointment scheduling when they were delayed in sending referrals and scheduling veterans’ Choice Program appointments. According to the VA contracting officer who is responsible for the Choice Program contracts, VA’s contracts with the TPAs do not include provisions for separating clinically urgent Choice Program referrals and authorizations from those that the VAMC or the TPA has decided to expedite for administrative reasons (such as when the veteran or VAMC staff has expressed frustration with a delay in the referral or appointment scheduling process). If Choice Program referrals for routine care are inappropriately categorized as urgent care referrals under the Choice Program, VHA’s data on the timeliness of urgent appointment scheduling and completion will not accurately reflect the extent to which veterans who have a clinical need for care are receiving care within the time frames required by the Choice Program. VHA’s initial analyses of the REFDOC tool’s effectiveness found that it sped up the process of preparing Choice Program referrals by about 20 minutes per referral, which helped reduce the administrative burden associated with preparing Choice Program referrals. However, VHA’s data on the timeliness of urgent appointment scheduling and completion will not accurately reflect the extent to which veterans who have a clinical need for care are receiving care within the time frames required by the Choice Program.

For example, entries can be restricted to only allow selections from a drop-down list or only allow dates to be entered. Second, only a small number of TSA employees enter information into these databases. TSA officials explained that typically one TSA employee is responsible for entering information from pipeline security reviews, and another individual, usually whoever conducted the review, is tasked to verify the accuracy of the data entered. As a result, according to the officials, any errors would be self-evident and caught during these TSA employees’ reviews.

As a result, TSA would not conduct a CFSR at any of these systems’ facilities because their operators identified none of them as critical. Also, another pipeline operator noted that they were working to implement the guidelines in the operations of a newly acquired asset that they determined was not using the guidelines in the same manner as their company. We evaluated the current performance measures included in the 2018 NSTS, the DHS fiscal year 2019 congressional budget justification, the CSR goals and priorities database, and the CFSR status database related to TSA’s Pipeline Security Branch. We primarily focused on key attributes which could be applied to individual measures. These include Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21), the NIPP, and Executive Order 13636. PPD-21, issued in February 2013, reflects an all-volunteer approach to protecting critical infrastructure, including natural disasters, terrorism, and cyber incidents. The directive also identifies the 16 critical infrastructure sectors and assigns roles and responsibilities for each critical infrastructure sector. The directive also identifies the 16 critical infrastructure sectors and assigns roles and responsibilities for each critical infrastructure sector. The directive also identifies the 16 critical infrastructure sectors and assigns roles and responsibilities for each critical infrastructure sector among nine designated federal sector-specific agencies The order also addressed the importance of cybersecurity skills among TSA staff. Specifically, 6 of the 10 pipeline operators and 3 of the 5 industry representatives we interviewed reported that the level of cybersecurity expertise among TSA staff and contractors may challenge the Pipeline Security Branch’s ability to fully assess the cybersecurity portions of its security reviews. TSA officials stated that Security Policy and Industry Engagement staff are working with DHS’s National Protection and Programs Directorate to help address the percentage of recommendations implemented to the CFSR status database and then reporting annual results. To make measures clearer, TSA could verify that each measure has a clearly stated name, definition, and methodology for how the measure is calculated. For example, the NSTS objective for security training mentioned above could have more specific language explaining how the measure is calculated and whether it applies to pipeline operators’ implementation of the training-related portions of the TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines or overall implementation. Additionally, adding baseline and trend data could allow TSA to identify, monitor, and report changes in performance and help ensure that performance is viewed in context. For example, the NSTS objective for security training mentioned above could have more specific language explaining how the measure is calculated and whether it applies to pipeline operators’ implementation of the training-related portions of the TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines or overall implementation. In addition, TSA and other federal entities have coordinated to address specific pipeline-related security incidents. For example, TSA officials coordinated with DOT, DOE, the Department of Justice, and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) priorities for critical infrastructure risk mitigation, such as information on natural hazards and the ability to measure risk reduction (feedback data).

According to BIA, as of June 2018, there were approximately 497 Indian land areas in the United States administered as federal Indian reservations or other tribal lands (e.g., pueblos, villages, and communities). Outcomes of delinquency cases in state and local courts were generally similar for Native American youth between 2010 and 2014, according to analysis of available data. For example, more than half of all cases received by the courts for both groups were male and 15 to 17 years old during the periods for which we obtained data. The federal government, however, has authority to regulate or modify the powers of self-government that tribes otherwise possess, and has exercised this authority to establish jurisdiction over certain crimes in Indian country. For example, the Major Crimes Act, as amended, provides the federal government with criminal jurisdiction over Indians in Indian Country charged with serious, felony-level offenses enumerated in the statute, such as murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, burglary, and robbery. The General Crimes Act, the Major Crimes Act, and Public Law Reform Act, which are broadly summarized in table 1, are the three federal laws central to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction in Indian country. In addition, the majority of youth for both groups were placed in state and local facilities. In addition, officials from a tribal nonprofit corporation in Alaska that represents several federally recognized tribal governments and Native American organizations told us that there is a high level of competition for juvenile justice in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BOP) for juvenile justice in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for juvenile justice in the U.S. Department of Justice (BJS) for juvenile justice in the U.S. Department of Justice (BOP) for juvenile justice in the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. Department of Justice) for juvenile justice in Indian country.

There are more than 2,400 courts across the country with juvenile justice systems, and a majority of youth are either referred to juvenile court or released. Juvenile courts handle two types of petitions: delinquency or Further, while some agencies, such as USMS and BOP, share a unique identifier for an individual within the federal data sources, there is no unique identifier across all federal and state and local data sources. For the purposes of this review, we focused on discretionary grants and cooperative agreements. We focused on discretionary grants and cooperative agreements because federal agencies generally award them to an array of entities based on a competitive review process, whereas federal agencies are generally required by statute to limit awards from the other types of grants to specific entities, typically U.S. state, local, and territorial governments. We then reviewed the search results of the three agencies with the highest number of grant program matches—DOI, DOJ, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The difference in sentence length may also be attributed to a number of additional variables that can affect the length of sentence, such as prior delinquent or criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offense. For example, DOJ’s Annual Survey of Jails in Indian country, 2016-2019 grant program funded the collection of information from all known correctional facilities operated by tribal governments or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some of the information the program sought to collect included the number of adults and youth held, the gender of the inmates, and average daily population, among other data. Runaway and homeless youth. Six of the 122 grant programs supported activities such as providing services to youth who have run away from home or who are experiencing homelessness. For example, HHS’s Annual Survey of Jails in Indian country, 2016-2019 grant program funded the collection of information from all known correctional facilities operated by tribal governments or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

  "have resulted in most taxpayers filing Forms 8938 also filing Form 8938 also filing FBARs with FinCEN. Duplicative filings on foreign financial assets cause confusion, frustration, and compliance burdens for taxpayers. Additionally, banking associations told us that it has taken time, effort, and expense for FFIs to process and store the same or similar information. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements can fully address the issues outlined above, and can allow for the use of FATCA information for prevention and detection of financial crimes. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. Lastly, FATCA has created challenges for some U.S. persons living abroad that go beyond increasing their tax compliance burdens. Some U.S. persons living abroad are still facing issues accessing financial services and employment and obtaining SSNs.

Some U.S. persons living abroad are still facing issues accessing financial services and employment and obtaining SSNs. Some U.S. persons living abroad are still facing issues accessing financial services and employment and obtaining SSNs. Treasury, State, and SSA have taken some steps to address these issues both separately and in coordination with each other. However, Treasury, as the agency ultimately responsible for effective administration of FATCA, currently lacks a collaborative mechanism with State and SSA to address ongoing issues. Establishing a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help agencies develop effective solutions to mitigate such burdens. We are making the following matter for congressional consideration: Congress should consider amending the Internal Revenue Code, Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, and other statutes, as needed, to address these issues.

We are making the following matter for congressional consideration: Congress should consider amending the Internal Revenue Code, Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, and other statutes, as needed, to address overlap in foreign financial asset reporting requirements for the purposes of tax compliance and detection, and prevention of financial crimes, such as by aligning the types of assets to be reported and those assets under FBAR. Further, as noted in table 3, the overlapping requirements lead to IRS and FinCEN collecting the same information on certain types of foreign financial assets. These totals likely understate the total number of Forms 8938 that U.S. persons may have filed unnecessarily in tax year 2016; due to data limitations, these totals exclude Forms 8938 without asset information stored in IRS’s databases, including most Forms 8938 Officials from one organization representing U.S. persons living abroad said penalties due to failure to report certain accounts on one or both forms can be significant, even if little or no taxes are owed on those accounts. According to an IRS official, collecting account information under FATCA ushered in an era of greater transparency; as noted above, FATCA’s passage sought to reduce tax evasion by creating greater transparency and accountability with respect to offshore accounts and other assets held by U.S. taxpayers. In its response to our draft report, IRS said that all financial institutions and foreign tax authorities that file required account information receive a notification listing administrative and other minor errors contained in their reporting. According to SSA officials, after an application is processed, it can take 3 to 6 months–-depending on the country’s mail service–-for an individual to receive a Social Security Card. This is significantly longer than the 2-week period it takes SSN applicants to receive a card after mailing in their applications from within the United States. According to Department of State (State) data, the annual number of approvals of requests for renunciations of U.S. persons living abroad increased nearly 178 percent during a 6-year period, from 1,601 in 2011—the year after FATCA was enacted—to 4,449 in 2016, the most recent year to which full data on renunciations were available. According to U.S. embassy documents and information provided by focus group participants and interviewees across all the countries we examined, FATCA was the reason or a contributing factor in some of these decisions and the resulting increase in total renunciations. Specific effects of FATCA on U.S. persons living abroad included reduced access to foreign financial assets. When FATCA was first introduced, it can take 3 to 6 months–-depending on the country’s mail service–-for the",

With the objective of reducing trade deficits, the Administration's trade policy has focused on withdrawing from or renegotiating existing trade agreements that the Administration views as being \"unfair;\" initiating new bilateral agreements; and responding to the trade practices of U.S. trade partners (whether geopolitical ally or adversary) that it views as unfair, illegal, or threatening to U.S. industry, with potential implications for U.S. industry, with potential implications for U.S. industry, with potential implications for U.S. industry. The format for these more focused trade issues is similar, consisting of background and perspective on the issue at hand and an assessment of their current status. The U.S.-Mexico Tomato Suspension Agreement is an agreement between DOC and signatory producers/exporters of fresh tomatoes grown in Mexico that suspends the U.S. AD investigation into whether Mexican fresh tomatoes were sold into the U.S. market. In January 2009, the United States escalated a long-running dispute with the EU over its refusal to accept imports of U.S. poultry that are subject to certain pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs). The House and Senate bills would allow regional groups representing less than 50% of U.S. agricultural products to initiate trade remedy cases. The U.S. tomato Suspension Agreement is an agreement between USDA and signatory producers/exporters of fresh tomatoes grown in the United States that suspends the U.S. AD investigation into whether Mexican fresh tomatoes were sold into the U.S. market at less than fair value. In the CVD investigation, DOC determined that Spanish ripe olive producers and exporters were subsidized at rates ranging from about 8% to 27%. In July, USITC determined that U.S. producers were materially injured by imports of ripe olives from Spain. This has become a concern for U.S. farmers.

The U.S. agricultural export promotion programs in Cuba—the Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program. The 2018 farm bill excluded payments made under MAL, LIP, TAP, and ELAP from annual individual payment limits. The in-quota tariffs for all three commodities are 1%, while the over-quota tariffs are set at 65%. Despite the low within-quota tariff, China's TRQs for wheat, rice, and corn have never been filled even when imported grains were priced lower and were more competitive than domestic grains. The EU's regulatory framework regarding biotechnology is generally regarded as one of the most stringent worldwide. The EU's regulatory framework regarding biotechnology is generally regarded as one of the most stringent worldwide. Many U.S. producers assert that EU labeling and traceability regulations for approving GE crops have effectively limited certain U.S. agricultural products in 2018. U.S. agricultural tariffs and TRQs are introduced as shocks into a multi-region, economy-wide model. The impacts of these changes are analyzed after the economy has adjusted to the shocks after full implementation of USMCA. The GSP provides duty-free tariff treatment for certain products from designated developing countries. U.S. agricultural imports under GSP totaled $2.4 billion in 2018, accounting for about 15% of the value of total U.S. beef exports. The Canadian dairy sector asserted that the suspension agreements had not worked as intended and had not entirely eliminated the injury caused by the subsidization and dumping of Mexican sugar. These tariffs affect about $1 billion in U.S. agricultural exports to the EU, representing 0.5% total U. U. U",
  " authority to review the decisions of asylum officers but did not grant applicants any right to appeal to these officials. The Immigration Act of 1990 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made several changes to the asylum-related provisions in the INA. The 1990 act amended INA §209 to increase the annual numerical limitation on asylee adjustment of status from 5,000 to 10,000. It also added new language to INA §208, making an alien who had been convicted of a crime categorized as an aggravated felony under the INA ineligible for asylum. The 1994 act further amended INA §208 to state that an asylum applicant was not entitled to employment authorization except as provided at the discretion of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State. The 1994 act also amended INA §208 to state that an asylum applicant was not entitled to employment authorization except as provided at the discretion of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State. The 1994 act further amended INA §208 to state that an asylum applicant was not entitled to employment authorization except as provided at the discretion of the Attorney General by regulation. In March 1994, INS published a proposed rule to streamline its asylum procedures that included a number of controversial provisions. The data displayed in Figure 1 are for applications, not individuals; an application may include a principal applicant and dependents. Figure 1 reflects the impact of various factors. Figure 1 reflects the impact of various factors. For example, reforms in the mid-1990s, which made the asylum system more restrictive, contributed to the decline in applications in the earlier years shown. A contributing factor to the decline in the later years depicted in Figure 1 was the influx of unaccompanied alien children from Central America seeking asylum. The data displayed in Figure 1 are for applications, not individuals; an application may include a principal applicant and dependents. The agency characterized the problem the proposal sought to address as follows: \"The existing system for adjudicating asylum claims cannot keep pace with incoming applications and does not permit the expeditious removal from the United States of those persons who[se] claims fail.\" The 1994 final rule, published in December 1994, made fundamental changes to the asylum adjudication process. Under the rule, the immigration courts became independent of INS. Under the rule, the immigration courts became independent of INS. Under the rule, INS asylum officers were no longer to deny asylum applications filed by aliens who appeared to be excludable or deportable, or to consider applications for withholding of deportation from such applicants, with limited exceptions. Instead, officers were to either grant such applicants asylum or immediately refer their claims to immigration judges, where the claims would be considered as part of exclusion or deportation proceedings. Asylum officers were to continue to issue approvals and denials in cases of asylum applications filed by aliens with a legal immigration status. In June 2018, Attorney General Sessions issued a decision regarding the adjudication of asylum claims based on the \"membership in a particular social group\" ground. In the past, asylum had been granted to certain victims of domestic violence or gang violence based on a finding of persecution on account of \"membership in a Among the l egislative options that have been put forward a re to add \"gender\" to the list of persecution in the United States. Under the INA, the immigration courts became independent of INS. Under the INA, the immigration courts became independent of INS. Under the INA, the immigration courts became independent of INS. Under the INA, the immigration courts became independent of INS. Under the INA, the immigration courts became independent of INS. Under the INA, asylum applications originally filed as affirmative applications against \"all appropriate records or databases maintained by the Attorney General and by the Secretary of State\" and a permanent bar to receiving any immigration benefits for aliens who knowingly file frivolous asylum applications after being notified of the consequences for doing so. IIRIRA also put asylum processing-related time frames in statute, including a requirement that \"in the absence of exceptional circumstances,\" administrative adjudication of an asylum request be completed within 180 days after the filing date. All these provisions are still in statute. IIRIRA modified and codified some existing and prior asylum regulations. It amended an existing INA provision on employment authorization by adding language prohibiting an alien who is not otherwise eligible for employment authorization from being granted such authorization earlier than 180 days after filing the asylum application. H.R. 391, as ordered to be reported by the House Judiciary Committee, would have amended the INA provisions on safe third country removals, termination of asylum upon return to the home country, frivolous asylum applications, and credible fear similarly to H.R. 4760 and H.R. 6136. In addition, this bill would have made a number of other changes to the asylum-related language in the INA. Among its asylum-related provisions, H.R. 391 would have clarified the INA definition of a refugee (which asylum applicants also have to satisfy), specifically the \"membership in a particular social group\" ground. It further amended",

However, NATO policy still views nonstrategic nuclear weapons as a deterrent to any potential adversary, and they also serve as a link among the NATO nations, with bases in several nations and shared responsibility for nuclear policy planning and decisionmaking.

They also serve as a visible reminder of the U.S. commitment to the defense of the United States and its allies. The United States, its allies, and analysts outside government engaged in a heated debate over the role of and need for U.S. nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.\" The allies pledged to \"seek to create the conditions for further reductions in the future.\" The Strategic Concept indicated that the goal in these reductions should be to \"seek Russian agreement to increase transparency on its nuclear weapons in Europe and relocate these weapons away from the territory of NATO members.\" Moreover, the document noted that \"the United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.\" But it then states that \"the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of nonstrategic nuclear weapons to achieve newly defined battlefield objectives. The Bush Administration countered this argument by noting that few nations acquire nuclear weapons in response to U.S. nuclear programs. They do so either to address their own regional security challenges, or to counter U.S. conventional superiority. They argued that \"the United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.\" But it then states that \"the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear weapons to achieve newly defined battlefield objectives. The Bush Administration countered this argument by noting that few nations acquire nuclear weapons in response to U.S. nuclear programs. They do so either to address their own regional security challenges, or to counter U.S. conventional superiority. The Obama Administration, in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, set out a different relationship between U.S. nuclear weapons policy and nonproliferation policy. They also agreed that \"nuclear weapons are a core component of NATO's deterrence and defense posture.\" They also agreed that \"nuclear weapons are a core component of NATO's deterrence and defense posture.\" They also agreed that \"nuclear weapons are a core component of NATO's deterrence and defence posture.\" They also agreed that \"nuclear weapons are a core component of NATO's overall capabilities for deterrence and defence,\" and that \"the Alliance's nuclear force posture currently meets the criteria for an effective deterrence and defence posture.\" This force posture includes shared rights and responsibilities, with nuclear weapons stored at bases on the territories of five NATO nations In addition, in response to concerns about Russian nuclear doctrine, the statement emphasized that \"any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict\" and, \"if the fundamental security of any of its members were to be threatened however, NATO has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that an adversary could hope to achieve.\" On the other hand, when Russia published the final draft of the doctrine, in early 2010, it did not specifically authorize the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. Instead, it stated that \"Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to a threat of nuclear weapons, and that the United States would seek to address how to ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the U.S. extended deterrent. No changes in U.S. extended deterrence capabilities will be made without close consultations with our allies and partners.\" Discussions about the presence of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons at bases in Europe and their role in NATO's strategy also increased in 2009 and 2010 during the drafting of NATO's most recent strategic concept. When asked about the absence of these weapons, this actually seemed to narrow the range, from the 2000 version that allowed for nuclear use \"in situations critical to the national security of the Russian Federation\" to the current form that states they might be used in a case \"that would put in danger the very existence of the state.\" The communique released after the Brussels summit in July 2018 reiterated many of the points raised in previous communiques. In this context, the allies noted that, \"in this context, it is of paramount importance that disarmament and non-proliferation commitments under existing treaties are honoured... \" and called on \"Russia to preserve the viability of the INF Treaty through ensuring full and verifiable compliance.\" The communique released after the Brussels summit in July 2018 reiterated many",

  "The United States has continued to support Colombia's economic recovery programs and place greater emphasis on counternarcotics and security. When Colombia hosted the Sixth Summit of the Americas in April 2012, President Obama and President Santos announced a new joint endeavor, the Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation. This joint effort, built on ongoing security cooperation, addresses hemispheric challenges, such as combating transnational organized crime, bolstering counternarcotics, strengthening institutions, and fostering resilient communities. Colombia's leadership role in the Pacific Alliance and Colombia's accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May 2018, following a review of the country's macroeconomic policies and changes, are major new developments. In analyzing nearly 2,000 massacres between 1980 and 2012 documented in the center's database, the report maintains that 58.9% were committed by paramilitaries, 17.3% by guerrillas, and 7.9% by public security forces.

Colombia has made progress on trade issues such as copyright, pharmaceuticals, fuel and trucking regulations, and labor concerns (including subcontracting methods and progress on resolving cases of violence against union activists). Congress remains interested in Colombia's future because the country has become one of the United States' closest allies. In addition to the U.S. response aims to help the Venezuelan arrivals as well as the local Colombian communities that are hosting them. In addition to humanitarian assistance, the United States is providing $37 million in bilateral assistance to support medium- and longer-term efforts by Colombia. The U.S. government has made progress on human rights violations in Colombia. The U.S. government has made progress on human rights violations in Colombia—especially those perpetrated by any recipients or potential recipients of U.S. assistance. Since 2002, U.S. funding for Plan Colombia and its follow-on strategies exceeded $10 billion in State Department and Defense Department programs. From FY2000 to FY2009, the United States provided foreign operations assistance to Colombia through the Andean Counterdrug Program (ACP) account, formerly known as the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, and other aid accounts. The FARC was then reportedly at the apogee of its strength, numbering an estimated 16,000 to 20,000 fighters under arms. This turmoil opened the way for the aggressive strategy advocated by Uribe. At President Uribe's August 2002 inauguration, the In 2009, President Uribe and the Colombian government began negotiations with the FARC, with the FARC serving as peace talk hosts and \"guarantors.\" Following the formal start in Norway, the actual negotiations began a month later in mid-November 2012 in Cuba, where the FARC-government talks continued until their conclusion in August 2016. In the midst of extended peace negotiations, Colombia's 2014 national elections presented a unique juncture for the country. Despite the controversies, President Uribe remained popular and his supporters urged him to reduce illegal narcotics trafficking through expanded counternarcotics cooperation. In 2010, President Uribe remained popular and his supporters urged him to run for a third term in 2010. Another referendum was proposed to alter the constitution to allow a third term; however, it was turned down by Colombia's Constitutional Court. Once it became clear that President Uribe was constitutionally ineligible to run again, Juan Manuel Santos of the pro-Uribe National Unity party (or Party of the U) quickly consolidated his preeminence in the 2010 presidential campaign. Santos, a centrist, who came from an elite family that once owned the country's largest newspaper, had served as Uribe's defense minister through 2009. In 2010, Santos campaigned on a continuation of the Uribe government's approach to security and its role encouraging free markets and economic opening, calling his reform policy \"Democratic Prosperity.\" In the May 2010 presidential race, Santos took almost twice as many votes as his nearest competitor, Antanas Mockus of the centrist Green Party, but he did not win a majority. Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2016, in part demonstrating strong international support for the peace agreement.

The UAE has put in place a \"Wages Protection System,\" an electronic salary payments system that requires companies with more than 100 workers to pay workers via approved banks and other financial institutions, thereby facilitating timely payment of agreed wages. The UAE has deferred to Saudi Arabia in formulating Arab or GCC proposals to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. And the UAE position on that issue aligns with other Arab states, for example in support of the Palestinian Authority (PA) bid for statehood recognition and opposition to the Trump Administration's 2018 recognition that Israel's capital is in Jerusalem and 2019 recognition of Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights.

In 2015, the UAE established a \"Major Non-NATO Ally\" (MNNA), or a mechanism UAE officials say they prefer: legislation that would declare the UAE a key U.S. defense partner. Two Gulf states—Kuwait and Bahrain—are designated as MNNAs. In 2014, the United States discussed a possible solution under which Iran might cede control of the disputed islands in exchange for rights to the seabed around them. Iran reduced its presence on Abu Musa as a confidence-building measure. In February 2007 the Bush Administration threatened to characterize the UAE as a \"Destination of Diversion Control\" and to restrict the export of certain technologies to it. A June 2010 Iran sanctions law, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA, P.L. 111-195 ), formally authorizes countries to be designated as Destinations of Diversion Control and subject to U.S. sanctions. The UAE avoided any such designation by strengthening its export control regime, including a September 2007 law, enacted with FNC concurrence, that tightened export controls. UAE authorities used that law to shut down 40 foreign and UAE firms allegedly involved in dual use exports to Iran and other countries. On October 29, 2018, the government announced it replaced a 2002 anti-money-laundering law with a new law that raises the country's anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules to international standards.

Regardless of the merits of these positions, the current patchwork of federal law generally is limited to specific industry participants, specific types of data, or data practices that are unfair or deceptive. This patchwork approach also extends to certain state laws. Although an examination of every state data security law is beyond the scope of this report, at least one state has undertaken a general and ambitious effort to regulate data security.

As some FTC Commissioners and commentators have noted, these legal limitations may be significant in determining the appropriate federal enforcement provisions in any national data security legislation. While Congress may not be able to legislate around constitutional constraints, future legislation could address some of these limitations—for instance, by allowing the FTC to seek penalties for first-time violations of rules, expanding its jurisdictions to include currently excluded entities, or providing the FTC notice-and-comment rulemaking authority. The FTC has taken the position that companies act deceptively when they gather, use, or disclose personal information in a way that contradicts their posted privacy policy or other statements, or when they fail to adequately protect personal information from unauthorized access despite promises that that they would do so.

  ", thus putting more pressure on the Turkish Cypriots to accept the Turkish Cypriot government's demands. The Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots agreed to accept the Turkish Cypriot government's demands. There was also reportedly a convergence on a new judicial court that would have equal Turkish and Greek Cypriot representation and an agreement that Cyprus would be represented in the European Parliament by four Greek and two Turkish Cypriot members of parliament. A federal supreme court also was identified in the joint statement. When the election campaign began, some observers felt Anastasiades could again come under a good deal of pressure from his presidential opponents for his failure to promote a solution to the Cyprus issue. In mid-April 2011, it was reported that the Turkish Cypriots had rejected the Turkish Cypriot government's demands for a new judicial court.

The Turkish Cypriot government had failed to reach an agreement with the Greek Cypriot government, despite the fact that some Turkish troops that might have remained under a compromise could have provided security to the Turkish Cypriots during the time the negotiations. In his September 2017 report on his mission of good offices in Cyprus, U.N. Secretary-General Guterres appeared to reaffirm that these convergences had been reached. The Turkish Cypriots continued to differ over was how a new, united Cyprus would be created. On May 11, 2015, the U.N. Special Envoy hosted a dinner for the Turkish Cypriots in what was described as a relaxed and positive setting. Akinci quickly named Ozdil Nami, the former \"foreign minister\" in the Eroglu government, as the new negotiator for the Turkish Cypriot side. On May 17, 2015, Anastasiades and Akinci were unable to overcome some of the barriers that have blocked their ability to secure a final agreement. Both leaders subsequently instructed their negotiators to meet regularly and agreed to meet with each other as necessary until January 9, 2017, when the negotiations would reconvene in Geneva. After the missed opportunity at Mont Pelerin, Anastasiades's decision to resume the negotiations, Anastasiades and Eroglu had presented maps outlining the territorial concessions they were prepared to make. However, when the Turkish Cypriots were trying to apply maximum pressure on the Turkish Cypriots to agree to compromise on several issues demanded by the Greek Cypriots as part of an eventual solution. The United States and the EU both intervened, restating the republic's right to explore for natural resources in its EEZ but asking both the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to tone down the rhetoric and for Turkey not to provoke additional tensions over the energy issue. In a March 15, 2018, press conference welcoming the visit to Cyprus of Anastasiades and Akinci, as well as a long-time acquaintance of Christofias, declared that \"a solution in Cyprus is possible by the end of 2008.\" He also declared that \"the goal was to establish a new partnership state in Cyprus, based on the political equality of the two peoples and the equal status of two constituent states.\" While the negotiations between Christofias and Talat appeared to get off to a fast start, the differences in positions quickly became apparent, and the talks, although held on a regular basis, soon began to bog down. During the campaign, Eroglu also criticized Talat for what he thought were too many concessions to the Greek Cypriots, including the agreement that a reunited Cyprus would hold a single sovereignty through which both sides would reunite. Nevertheless, even while criticizing Talat's positions, Eroglu may have suggested that perhaps Cyprus should consider a kind of \"soft divorce\" similar to what the Slovaks and Czechs did when they separated. During the campaign, Eroglu also criticized Talat for what he thought that both sides, including Akinci, had begun to",
  "FA for marking, recordkeeping, or registering the same. Less expansive proposals purport only to remove silencers from NFA regulation. Thus, if the bills were enacted, silencers would not be subject to the NFA's tax and registration requirements but would still be subject to all GCA firearm regulations. This is so, according to the Supreme Court, because of the \"background presumption that every citizen knows the law,\" thus making it \"unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to prove that 'an evil-meaning mind' directed the 'evil-doing hand.'\" Further, to prosecute unlawful possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), the federal courts of appeals have consistently concluded that the federal courts of appeals have the authority to determine whether or not the law is constitutional, and whether or not the federal courts of appeals have the authority to determine whether or not the law is constitutional. The Federal courts of appeals have consistently concluded that the federal courts of appeals have consistently concluded that the government must prove only that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm but not that he had knowledge of the circumstances disqualifying him from possessing a firearm. For example, a prosecutor may prove a knowing violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)—the GCA provision that bars felons from possessing firearms—by establishing only that the defendant knew that he possessed a firearm but not that he knew of his status as a felon at the time he possessed the firearm. The preemption doctrine derives from the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which declares that \"the Laws of the United States... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\" Congress, through legislation lawfully enacted pursuant to an independent source of constitutional authority, may \"preempt\" (i.e., invalidate) state law. The Supreme Court has articulated that the doctrine operates as follows: \"Congress enacts a law that imposes restrictions or confers rights on private actors; a state law confers or imposes restrictions that conflict with the federal law; and therefore the federal law takes precedence and the state law is preempted.\" In other words, whenever states and the federal government regulate in the same area, like firearms, and the state and federal measures conflict, the law is to be resolved in favor of the federal government. The term committed to a mental institution has also been interpreted in regulations as including a \"formal commitment\" for \"mental defectiveness,\" mental illness, or \"other reasons, such as drug use\" by a \"court, board, commission, or other lawful authority\" that is \"involuntary.\" The Due Process Clause has a substantive and procedural component, described below, and may become relevant in the context on firearms regulation. For example, the GCA prohibits any person from manufacturing or importing a firearm for self-defense. The GCA prohibits any person from manufacturing or importing a firearm for self-defense. The GCA prohibits any person from manufacturing or importing a firearm for self-defense. The GCA prohibits any person from purchasing a firearm for self-defense. The GCA prohibits any person from purchasing a firearm for self-defense. The GCA prohibits any person from purchasing a firearm for self-defense. The GCA prohibits any person from purchasing a firearm for self-defense unless (1) the firearm is for the use of the U.S. government, a state, or a political subdivision of a state; (2) the ammunition is to be exported; or (3) the ammunition is to be tested or used for experimentation as authorized by the Attorney General. A person who possesses armor-piercing ammunition with a firearm \"during and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\" is also subject to separate criminal sentencing provisions. Finally, a person who has been convicted of a felony crime of violence is barred from purchasing, owning, or possessing body armor unless the person has obtained prior written certification from his or her employer that the body armor is needed \"for the safe performance of lawful business activity\" and the armor's use is limited to the course of such performance. The GCA, as amended, regulates the manufacture, transfer, and possession of firearms, extending to categories of weapons that fall outside the scope of the U.S. Constitution.

Given the magnitude and frequency of U.S. trade with NAFTA partners, the proposed USMCA government procurement chapter only applies to procurement between Mexico and the United States.

It also provides a discussion of policy implications for Congress going forward. It covers largely the same entities and maintains the same thresholds as NAFTA, as adjusted annually for inflation. Proponents of the higher de minimis thresholds contend that these changes will facilitate North American trade by allowing low-value parcels to be shipped across international borders tax and tariff free and with simple customs forms. Some observers contend that manufacturers with a stronger presence in Mexico, such as General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, may be more impacted. NAFTA negotiations were first launched under President George H. W. Bush. NAFTA negotiations were first launched under President George H. W. Bush. Two-way investment between Canada and the United States has increased markedly since NAFTA, both in terms of the stock and flow of investment. The United States is the largest single investor in Canada with a stock of FDI into Canada reaching $391.2 billion in 2017, up from a stock of $69.9 billion in 1993 (see Figure 6 ).

In return, the United States excluded dairy, sugar, cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and peanut butter. NAFTA resulted in tariff elimination for most agricultural products and redefined import quotas for some commodities as tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), some products are still subject to high above-quota tariffs, such as U.S. dairy and poultry exports to Canada. The two countries cooperated to resolve the issue over time and engaged in numerous talks regarding safety and operational issues. The conclusion of NAFTA trucking provisions was a major trade issue between the United States and Mexico for many years because the United States delayed its trucking commitments under NAFTA. NAFTA provided Mexican commercial trucks full access to four U.S.-border states by 1995 and full access throughout the United States by 2000. The two countries cooperated to resolve the issue over time and engaged in numerous talks regarding safety and operational issues.

  "According to the Supreme Court's interpretation of Article III of the Constitution, the Court determined that, although the Member plaintiffs had a \"stronger case\" for standing than the plaintiffs had in Raines, historical practice, a lack of congressional authorization, and the availability of alternative remedies demonstrated that the injury was too \"wholly abstract\" and \"widely dispersed\" to confer standing on an individual Member. These cases make clear that the key difference between the Arizona legislature and the plaintiffs in Raines was that the former was \"an institutional plaintiff asserting an institutional injury [that had] commenced this action after authorizing votes in both of its chambers.\" The problem with the individual Members asserting institutional injury in Raines, as the Arizona State Legislature Court saw it, was that the injury was \"widely dispersed,\" and no plaintiff in the 1997 case could \"tenably claim a personal stake in the suit.\" In contrast with Raines, the Court concluded, Arizona State Legislature was closer to the Coleman facts, in that the Commission's authority \"completely nullif[ied]\" any vote by the legislature purporting to adopt a redistricting plan—and that injury was adequately particularized to the plaintiff that was bringing the suit. Importantly, however, the Court stated in a footnote that, even though Congress may not \"abrogate the Art[icle] III minima,\" Congress may under presently undefined circumstances enact a statute that grants it standing to pursue a claim in federal court that it could not pursue in that statute's absence. In other words, the Court has explicitly considered and rejected several types of abstract injuries. For instance, the Court held that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Commission's authority \"completely nullif[ied]\" any vote by the legislature purporting to adopt a redistricting plan—and that injury was adequately particularized to the plaintiff that was bringing the suit. In the absence of such guidance from the judiciary, both the Senate and the House had intervened in the case to defend the statute's constitutionality. The Court therefore held that, because Congress was \"a proper party to defend the constitutionality of\" this statute, \"the concrete adverseness\" required by Article III existed \"beyond doubt\" \"from the time of Congress' formal intervention\" in the case. With respect to cases brought by individual legislators, Raines drew a fundamental distinction between so-called \"institutional injury\" and the sort of personal injury that was at issue with the plaintiff's lost salary in Powell. As the Court would go on to explain in Arizona State Legislature, an \"institutional injury\" is an injury that \"scarcely zeroe[s] on the rights of individuals.\" By contrast, \"[v]indicating the public interest (including the public interest in Government observance of the Constitution and laws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.\" The federal courts apply a number of doctrines, known as justiciability doctrines, to ensure that they do not apply them to individual members of Congress. For instance, the Court noted that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the Court had no doubt that the President's conduct, in allegedly accepting emoluments and failing to submit those emoluments to Congress, had nullified their votes. In both Baird and Kerr, the court interpreted the standing upheld in Coleman, the so-called vote nullification injury, as being about the deprivation inflicted on individual legislators by virtue of their vote being defeated by the allegedly unlawful action. In contrast, after Campbell, the D.C. Circuit has focused on the lack of a legislative remedy and whether the legislature as a whole continues to enjoy \"ample legislative power\" to remedy the alleged wrong. As an example of a putative injury in the latter category, courts have generally rejected the idea that legislatures have standing based on their duty to legislate to challenge allegedly illegal acts by the Executive. In Alaska Legislative Council v. Babbitt, for instance, the D.C. Circuit determined that a legislative plaintiff acting pursuant to the authorization of its respective institution generally possesses standing to sue to redress concrete and particular informational injuries to",

The Secretary of Agriculture authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a new program for the management of NFS land. Section 302 of the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill enacted provisions that would change how FS and BLM manage NFS lands. These provisions are similar to those that govern the NFS. These provisions established, reauthorized, or modified specific authorities. For example, Section 8623 of the 2018 farm bill established a new program authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture, for NFS lands, and the Secretary of the Interior, for BLM lands, to establish a CE for NFS land. Section 8623 of the 2018 farm bill establishes a new program for NFS land. Section 8623 of the 2018 farm bill establishes a new program for NFS land.

These programs are elements of the FS's \"Shared Stewardship\" approach to address land management concerns at a landscape-scale and across ownership boundaries. These programs are generally perceived as offering opportunities to accelerate forest restoration to mitigate against insect and disease infestations or reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires to federal lands and surrounding communities. For example, the Forest Service has identified around 52-58 million acres of NFS lands at high or very high fire risk or insect infestation and in need of restoration treatments. FS reports that they accomplish around 2-6 million acres of treatments annually. At that pace, it would take at least 9 but possibly up to 29 years to eliminate the backlog of treatment needs, and that does not account for maintaining already treated areas to the desired resource conditions. These programs are generally perceived as offering opportunities to accelerate forest restoration to mitigate against insect and disease infestations. Broadly, NEPA requires federal agencies to identify the environmental impacts of a proposed action before making a final decision about that action. How a federal agency demonstrates compliance with NEPA depends on the level of the proposal's impacts. A proposed action that would significantly affect the \"quality of the human environment\" requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) leading to a Record of Decision. If the impacts are uncertain, an agency may prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to determine whether an EIS is necessary, or whether a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) may be issued through a Decision Notice. The 115 th Congress enacted provisions that affect how FS and BLM implement those activities and procedural requirements. The 115 th Congress enacted provisions that affect how FS and BLM implement those activities and procedural requirements. The provisions are generally perceived as offering opportunities to accelerate forest restoration to mitigate against insect and disease infestations, but may repair existing permanent roads. Temporary roads shall be decommissioned, but may repair existing permanent roads. FS and BLM have proposed to address the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental actions (i.e., trade goods for services). The specified land management goals include objectives such as restoring or maintaining water quality through road and trail maintenance or obliteration, improving forest health and reducing fire hazards, increasing soil productivity, restoring and maintaining watersheds, restoring and maintaining fish and wildlife, and reestablishing native plant species. FS and BLM can deposit any timber sale revenue exceeding the cost of contracted services (referred to as excess revenue) in their respective Stewardship Contracting Fund. FS and BLM may use the funds on other stewardship projects without further appropriation. The law authorized contracts to be awarded on a best-value basis, meaning FS and BLM may consider past performance, proposal quality, and other factors in addition to cost, and allows FS and BLM to give procurement preference for contractors making innovative use of wood products. FS and BLM are required to submit annual reports on the development, execution, administration, and accomplishments of stewardship contracts. Stewardship contracting is generally perceived favorably among stakeholders. The agencies report increased opportunities for accomplishing more restoration goals and improving collaborative relationships. The new adjustment would apply to appropriations provided above an amount equal to the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations. This new adjustment starts in FY2020 and continues for each year thereafter through FY2027. For the purposes of the adjustment, wildfire suppression operations includes spending for the purposes of the emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting, including support, response, and emergency stabilization activities; other emergency management activities; and funds necessary to repay any transfers needed for these costs",
  ", whereas the Second Amendment requires states to comply with the Bill of Rights. If it does not, the inquiry ends, as the law does not implicate the Second Amendment. But if the challenged law does implicate the Second Amendment, the court concludes that the Second Amendment does not implicate the Second Amendment. If the Second Amendment does implicate the Second Amendment, the court concludes that the Second Amendment does not implicate the Second Amendment. If the Second Amendment does implicate the Second Amendment, the court concludes that the Second Amendment does implicate the Second Amendment. If the Second Amendment does implicate the Second Amendment, the court concludes that the Second Amendment does implicate the Second Amendment. In reaching that conclusion, the Court emphasized that the Second Amendment must be interpreted in the context in which it was enacted: \"[w]ith [the] obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of\" Congress's power to \"provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia.\" If, on the other hand, the challenged law does implicate the Second Amendment, courts must next decide the appropriate level of scrutiny—rational basis, intermediate, or strict scrutiny—to employ in determining whether the law passes constitutional muster. In deciding which level to choose, courts generally ask whether the challenged law burdens core Second Amendment conduct, like the ability to use a firearm for self-defense in the home. If not, the court requires the government to make a \"strong showing\" that a firearm regulation bears a \"substantial relation\" to an important governmental objective—a standard that resembles the intermediate scrutiny standard of review. It is also worth noting that, although the D.C. Circuit has applied the two-step approach when evaluating firearm legislation, courts must next decide the appropriate level of scrutiny—rational basis, intermediate, or strict scrutiny—to employ in determining whether the law passes constitutional muster. In deciding which level to choose, courts generally ask whether the challenged law burdens core Second Amendment conduct, like the ability to use a firearm for self-defense in the home. If a law substantially burdens core Second Amendment activity, courts typically will apply strict scrutiny. Otherwise, courts will apply intermediate scrutiny. In addition, sometimes circuit courts have taken a different approach by asking whether the defendant did more than merely possess a weapon in a home shared with a convicted felon, but actually aided and abetted that felon in possessing the firearm himself. The court concluded that the Second Amendment does not substantially burden the Second Amendment. The court concluded that the Second Amendment does not substantially burden the Second Amendment given Heller's comment that \"the Second Amendment does not afford citizens a right to carry arms for 'any purpose.'\" And aiding and abetting a convicted felon in possessing a firearm, the court concluded, is not a protected right. A 1996 amendment to the Gun Control Act, commonly referred to as the Lautenberg Amendment and codified at 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), prohibits persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from possessing firearms. Thus far, reviewing courts have uniformly upheld the provision against Second Amendment challenges. Several.g., handguns, non-automatic long guns) for self-defense in the home or hunting. Next, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the ban survived intermediate scrutiny because the record evidence substantiated the District's assertion that the ban was substantially related to protecting police officers and crime control. For example, evidence submitted \"suggest[ed that] assault weapons are preferred by criminals and place law enforcement 'at particular risk... because of their high firepower.'\" And \"the risk 'posed by military-style assault weapons,\" according to the court reasoned, is consistent with the right to bear arms, particularly given that \"there is no right to engage in self-defense with a firearm until the objective circumstances justify the use of deadly force.\" California has a somewhat similar law as that upheld in Kachalsky : An officer \"may\" issue a concealed carry license to applicants who have demonstrated good moral character and good cause for the license. The court concluded that the federal ban on juvenile possession of handguns fell within Heller's safe harbor for longstanding restrictions on firearm possession. Another provision in the Gun Control Act (and corresponding regulations) makes it unlawful for firearm dealers to sell handguns to persons under 21 years old. The court was challenged in National Rifle Association v. ATF by persons between 18 and 21 years old who argued that the Second Amendment \"does not extend to the carrying of concealed firearms in public by members of the general public.\" Accordingly, because concealed carry is not encompassed by the Second Amendment, the court concluded that those must be evaluated under intermediate scrutiny to determine their constitutionality. The D.C. Circuit concluded that the \"mere registration\" of a handgun, alone, is a presumptively lawful, longstanding regulation \"deeply enough rooted in our history to support the presumption that a registration requirement is constitutional.\" But as applied to long guns, the court concluded, registration is novel. As for some of D.C.'s, registration is novel",

Relevant assistance provided by the U.S. government to combat corruption includes assistance and efforts by U.S. State Department, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), outlined below. In late 2018, Colombia's current Attorney General, Néstor Humberto Martínez, was linked to Odebrecht bribes when he served as legal counsel to the Aval Group, a New York Stock Exchange-listed conglomerate run by the Colombia's wealthiest individual. In May 2019, Martínez announced his resignation from the U.S. Attorney General's office. In the U.S. Attorney General's Office, the U.S. Attorney General's Office, the U.S. Attorney General's Office, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney General's Office, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice. Although the fight against corruption is a global effort, this report focuses more closely on U.S. interests in fighting corruption in the region, and how U.S. policy and assistance programs have developed to address that goal. Contemporary anti-corruption efforts in Brazil, Mexico, and Central America are examined as case studies. The report closes with considerations for Congress in conducting its oversight role over U.S. funded anti-corruption efforts in the region and pursuing the policy objective of broadening the rule of law and encouraging good government. In recent years, the annual foreign operations appropriation has required that the Secretary of State ban entry by individuals (officials of a foreign government and immediate family members) if the Secretary has direct knowledge of their involvement in significant acts of corruption, such as gross violations of human rights or illicit practices tied to natural resource extraction. As a result of CICIG's success, civil society groups pushed for a similar institution in Honduras, leading to the establishment of the OAS-backed Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras. The report closes with considerations for Congress in conducting its oversight role over U.S. funded anti-corruption efforts in the region and pursuing the policy objective of broadening the rule of law and encouraging good government. In the wake of numerous scandals, particularly regarding the multi-country scandal involving the Odebrecht corporation, corruption has become a searing, top-level concern in many Latin American nations, with implications for U.S. policy. In the last 30 years, USAID and State Department have funded programs to reinforce institutions that tackle corruption and cultivate a \"culture of transparency\" and integrity. Some analysts maintain that corruption is so entrenched that it is now endemic in the region and that the U.S. government, which is responsible for the elimination of corruption in the region, may continue to be held in preventive detention for up to three years. The Public Ministry opened an According to Narra, governors made common practice of using intimidation and bribery to quash or co-opt dissent. Brazilian officials and outside analysts have identified several legal and institutional reforms that have facilitated these anti-corruption efforts. The country's 1988 constitution grants autonomy to the office of the attorney general ( Ministério Público Federal, MPF), and, due to institutional norms that have since developed, the practice has become entrenched of the president selecting the attorney general from a list of candidates created by federal prosecutors. This operational independence has enabled the MPF to pursue politically sensitive cases against high-ranking officials. The middle class is a bulwark against corruption according to the theory that the costs and inefficiencies of corruption take on greater salience when basic needs have been fulfilled. An analysis of the 2016/2017 Americas barometer study found that those individuals most apt to rank corruption as their nation's top problem were better educated, male, and more affluent. Brazil. In Brazil, a sprawling corruption investigation underway since 2014 known as Lavo Jato (Car Wash, in English) implicated much of the political class. Brazil's multinational construction firm Odebrecht was one of the firms involved, and, in a landmark plea agreement, admitted to paying millions in bribes to politicians and office holders throughout Latin America. In August 2018, federal authorities in Argentina arrested 12 former government officials and business executives on corruption-related charges. Fernandez de Kirchner has immunity from arrest as a sitting senator, but she can be prosecuted on the charges. The Committee of Experts manages and supervises the technical review",
  "deployed U.S. Navy ships. The point here is not to excuse away cost growth, because cost growth can occur in a program for reasons other than DOD's attempt to pressurize industry. Nor is the point to abandon the goal of seeking lower rather than higher procurement cost growth, because, as noted above, there is a legitimate public policy value in pursuing this goal. The point, rather, is to recognize that this goal is not always synonymous with minimizing procurement cost, and that a possibility of some amount of cost growth might be expected as part of an optimal government strategy for minimizing procurement cost. Recognizing that the goals of seeking lower rather than higher cost growth and of minimizing procurement cost can sometimes be in tension with one another can lead to an approach that takes both goals into consideration. In contrast, an approach that is instead characterized by a sustained, singular focus on avoiding and minimizing cost growth may appear virtuous, but in the end may wind up costing the government more.

(This report also covers the issue of the Administration's FY2020 budget proposal, which the Administration withdrew on April 30, to not fund a proposed new force-structure plan, but changes over time in mission requirements, technologies available to ships for performing missions, and other force-planning factors, as well as the possibility that earlier force-structure plans might not have been appropriate for meeting the mission demands of their times, suggest that some caution should be applied in using past force structure plans for this purpose, particularly if those past force structure plans are more than a few years old. Appendix C. Comparing Past Ship Force Levels to Current or Potential Future Ship Force Levels In assessing the appropriateness of the current or potential future number of ships in the Navy, observers sometimes compare that number to historical figures for total Navy fleet size. Historical figures A January 13, 2017, press report states the following: The Navy's production lines are hot and the work to prepare them for the possibility of building out a much larger fleet would be manageable, the service's head of acquisition said Thursday. From a logistics perspective, building the fleet from its current 274 ships to 355, as recommended in the Navy's newest force structure assessment in December, would be straightforward, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition Sean Stackley told reporters at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium. \"By virtue of maintaining these hot production lines, frankly, over the last eight years, our facilities are in pretty good shape,\" Stackley said. The latest discussions are \"certainly something that a shipbuilder wants to hear,\" he said. \"We do have the capability of increasing throughput if the need and demand were to arise, and then we also have the ability with the present workforce and facility to meet a different mix that could arise as well.\" Appendix C. Comparing Past Ship Force Levels to Current or Potential Future Ship Force Levels In response to this basic feature of world geography, U.S. policymakers for the past several decades have chosen to use the world's oceans—a global commons that covers more than two-thirds of the planet's surface—into a medium of maneuver and operations for projecting U.S. power ashore and otherwise defending U.S. interests in the coming years. As shown in Table 4, the Navy in the FY2020 budget submission makes some changes within the five-year period to the use of the world's oceans.

  ". biomedical research, has also varied from year to year—likely due to a combination of decreased purchasing power as well as an increasing pool of applicants. Generally, specific amounts are appropriated to each IC, and then funding is awarded through competitive grants, contracts, or to intramural researchers. In recent years, report language accompanying appropriations acts and laws such as the 21 st Century Cures Act ( P.L. 114-255 ) have included more specified funding amounts for research areas and programs. For example, the report accompanying the FY2019 LHHS conference appropriations bill ( H.Rept. 115-952, pp. 529-530) directed specific funding increases for the following at NIH: Alzheimer's disease research, antibiotic resistant bacteria research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, clinical research, and the Institutional Development Awards (IDeA) program. The 21 st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, authorized specific appropriations for four innovation projects (as described in the \" 21 st Century Cures Act \" section of this report). Other laws that have directed funding to specific research areas include the NIH, FDA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), and over 30 other companies and nonprofit organizations. Public-private partnerships are facilitated by the NIH's commitment to \"preserve the vibrancy of the diverse workforce.\" The 21 st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, authorized specific appropriations for four innovation projects (as described in the \" 21 st Century Cures Act \" section of this report).

The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) is concerned about retaining and attracting new scientists for biomedical research. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, the number of national research institutes and national centers may not exceed a total of 27\" (see discussion in \" NIH Reform Act of 2006 \"). President Trump's FY2019 and FY2018 budget requests also proposed consolidating AHRQ and other HHS institutes into NIH; however, Congress did not adopt these proposals. NIH's large and decentralized organizational structure has been an issue of concern. There are costs and complexities of administering an agency made of 27 ICs, each with its own mission, budget, staff, review office, and other organizational apparatus. The allocation of NIH research dollars is a major source of debate. NIH has seen periods of both low and high, and it engages in a number of information dissemination activities to reach various audiences. Funding for research makes up most of NIH spending. In May 2017, NIH proposed to cap funding for highly funded investigators through a measure termed the Grant Support Index (GSI) to free up funding to early-stage investigators and others who receive less funding. In inflation-adjusted FY2019 dollars, the NIH program level remains 9% below the 2003 level. Under President Trump's FY2020 budget request, NIH would be provided a program level of $34.3 billion—a 12.6% reduction from the FY2019 program level. In inflation-adjusted FY2020 dollars, this proposed FY2020 program level would be 22.6% below the peak 2003 level. The IC strategic planning processes are conducted pursuant to PHSA Section 402(b)(5), which specifies that the NIH Director \"shall ensure that scientifically based strategic planning is implemented in support of research priorities as determined by the agencies of the National Institutes of Health.\" The Cures Act ( P.L. 114-255 ) amended PHSA Section 402 to require an NIH-Wide Strategic Plan, in part to facilitate IC collaboration and coordination. In the first NIH-Wide Strategic Plan 2016-2020, the NIH specifies its agency-wide process for setting research priorities. As stated in the Strategic Plan, \"The process of setting NIH's research priorities must balance the opportunities presented by the best science, public health needs, and the unique ability of NIH to address challenges in human health that would otherwise go unmet.\" In its Strategic Plan, the NIH reaffirmed its commitment to a transparent and evidence-based process for funding decisions that prioritized the four principles listed below.

  "-shifting test for assessing disparate impact liability under the FHA. At step one, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing evidence that a housing decision or policy caused a disparate impact on a protected class. At step two, defendants can counter the plaintiff's prima facie showing by establishing that the challenged policy or decision is \"necessary to achieve a valid interest.\" The defendant will not be liable for the disparate impact resulting from a \"valid interest\" unless, at step three, the plaintiff proves \"that there is an available alternative … practice that has less disparate impact and serves the entity's legitimate needs.\" In June 2016, during the 114 th Congress, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register proposing to require certain PHAs to use SAFMRs in the administration of their HCV programs if they had high levels of housing needs. This provision was not enacted before the end of the 115 th Congress. In June 2016, during the 114 th Congress, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register proposing to require certain PHAs to use SAFMRs in the administration of their HCV programs if they had high levels of vouchers concentrated in high-poverty areas. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-142 ), signed into law in December 2007, temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt income that is associated with a primary residence from taxation. The provision was originally effective for debt discharged before January 1, 2010, and was subsequently extended several times. Rationales put forward for extending the exclusion have included minimizing hardship for distressed households, lessening the risk that nontax homeownership rates will increase, and assisting in the recoveries of the housing market and overall economy. Arguments against the exclusion have included concerns that it makes debt forgiveness more attractive for homeowners, which could encourage homeowners to be less responsible about fulfilling debt obligations, and concerns about fairness as the standard deduction to be more valuable. Mortgage interest rates have generally increased since the start of 2018, though they decreased somewhat in December 2018, ending the year at 4.64%. Rising interest rates may make mortgages less affordable for some households, contributing to homeownership affordability pressures. As house prices have been rising for several years on a national basis, and as mortgage interest rates have also begun to rise, concerns about the affordability of owner-occupied housing have increased. Incomes have also been rising in recent years, helping to mitigate some affordability pressures, but in general incomes have not been rising as quickly as house prices. Despite rising house prices, many metrics of housing affordability suggest that owner-occupied housing is currently relatively affordable. These metrics generally measure the share of income that a median-income family would need to qualify for a mortgage to purchase a home. Housing conditions in the United States are generally worse than those in the United States as a whole, contributing to homeownership affordability pressures. As a result of the current housing market turmoil, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHA) have proposed to increase the amount of housing assistance available to homeowners in the U.S. and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHA) to increase the amount of housing assistance available to homeowners in the United States. In response to concerns about housing affordability, several bills were introduced in the 115 th Congress that focused on addressing the issue of housing affordability broadly, but through different approaches. Some proposals were focused on demand-side solutions, in the form of new or increased subsidies for certain renters or homeowners meant to make it easier for those households to afford housing. In February 2018, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act of FY2018 (BBA;  P.L. 115-123 ), which, among other things, increased the statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2018 and FY2019. Following passage of the BBA, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ) was enacted in March 2018, providing final FY2018 appropriations for HUD. The enacted legislation increased overall funding for HUD by nearly 10% compared to FY2017 and did not adopt the program eliminations proposed in the President's budget request. Most HUD funding accounts saw increases in FY2018 compared to FY2017. As of the end of the 115 th Congress, final FY2019 appropriations for HUD had not yet been enacted. HUD programs and activities were funded under continuing resolutions through December 21, 2018, at which point funding lapsed. This funding lapse was still underway when the 115 th Congress ended.

Reducing the number of RL and SRL properties, through mitigation or relocation, could reduce claims and improve the NFIP's financial position. Under current statute, the NFIP cannot refuse to insure any property; however, from April 1, 2019, FEMA will introduce an SRL premium equal to 5% of the annual premium for SRL properties. Much like NCTC for terrorism, CTIIC provides outreach to other intelligence organizations across the federal government and at the state, and local levels to facilitate intelligence sharing and provide an integrated effort for assessing and providing warning of cyber threats. The term \"One DHS\" was used to describe these initiatives, including rules for carriers supporting 911 services; state and local use of 911 fees; public safety, including rules for carriers delivering wireless alerts to mobile phones; disaster management and reporting of private network outages; and restoration efforts. As of January 2019, the NFIP has $9.9 billion of remaining borrowing authority. Few private insurers compete with the NFIP in the primary residential flood insurance market. However, private insurer interest in providing flood coverage has increased recently, and many see private insurance as a way of transferring flood risk from the federal government to the private sector. For example, FEMA has paid $4.82 billion of its flood risk to the capital markets through reinsurance in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Private flood insurance may offer some potential advantages over the NFIP, including more flexible policies, broader coverage, integrated coverage with homeowners' insurance, and lower-cost coverage for some consumers. Private marketing also might increase the overall amount of flood coverage purchased. Since 2005, the NFIP has paid $2.82 billion in principal repayments and $4.2 billion in interest to service the debt through the premiums collected on insurance",

The Navy's current assessment is we will get through all of the production and much of the testing. We may have some of the requirements for CVN 79, the latter being a ship currently planned for procurement in FY2028. The Navy plans to fully fund the ship beginning in FY2019 and extending beyond FY2026 using incremental funding authorized by Section 121(c) of P.L. 115-232. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,285.0 million in procurement funding for the ship. The ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in February 2032.

  ", in 1973, with the nomination and confirmation of Representative Gerald R. Ford as Vice President, and in 1974, with the nomination and confirmation of New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller as Vice President. From the standpoint of amending the Constitution to limit Presidents to a single term, Jackson himself recommended that Congress consider an amendment that would establish a single four- or six-year presidential term in his Annual Messages to Congress in 1835. William Henry Harrison (1841) recommended a constitutional amendment to prohibit \"the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the Presidency\" in his 1841 inaugural address, while his Whig Party called for \"a single term for the presidency\" three years later in 1844. It was widely held that in these circumstances a single term would be necessary to avoid excessive congressional influence over the presidency, or worse, the unseemly spectacle of the executive scrambling to ensure congressional support for reelection to a second term. At least a solid minority of delegates, which occasionally expanded to a majority, also opposed eligibility for reelection for the executive on general principle. They feared this provision might result in the imposition of a second term for the President and vice president. In fact, the amendment was proposed to the United States Senate on March 24, 1947. The amendment was proposed to the Senate on March 24, 1947. The amendment was proposed to the Senate on March 24, 1947. The Senate became the 36 th state to ratify the proposal on February 27, 1951, and it was declared to be ratified and effective on March 1 of the same year. In addition, most contained a variant of the existing Twenty-Second Amendment provision for Vice Presidents who succeed to the highest office: they would be eligible for election in their own right to a term as President provided they had served less than three years of the term on which their predecessor was elected. The basic provisions of most of these proposals called for a six-year term for the President and Vice President, with each limited to a single term. In addition, none of the eight Presidents who served between Jackson and Lincoln was elected to a second term. While such events indicate the acceptance of the single-term presidency during this period, the short tenures of these chief executives are arguably also due to the vagaries of political life: electoral defeat or rejection by their parties, and, in two instances, death in office. In fact, most of these proposed amendments would also have specifically repealed the Twenty-Second Amendment. Over the years, proponents of the single six-year term have deployed a range of arguments in support of their position. Perhaps most prominent, they assert that it would end the \"permanent campaign\" for reelection, which is said to begin as soon as a newly elected President is inaugurated for a first term. According to this theory, the chief executive would be freed from the distraction of partisan political concerns associated with planning and campaigning for reelection, and would be able to concentrate on legislation, administration, and development of a program of public policy. By the 20 th century, the term of the President and Vice President had been extended to two terms, with each limited to a single term, with each limited to a single term. In the final analysis of the Twenty-Second Amendment, it is important to note that there have been a number of amendments to the Twenty-Second Amendment that have been introduced in the past two decades, and, key to the issue, a reworked method of election, by an electoral college appointed in each state \"in such manner as its Legislature may direct.\" The committee's novel solution ultimately resolved the impasse. Although several die-hard opponents continued to argue in favor of legislative election, a single term, or shorter terms, all such motions were defeated by wide margins. During the two decades between the end of Eisenhower's second term in 1961 and the election of President Ronald Reagan in 1980, two presidencies ended prematurely, John Kennedy's by assassination in 1963 and Richard Nixon's by resignation in 1974. Two other Presidents were defeated for election: Gerald Ford, who succeeded as President when Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, lost his bid for election in 1976, while his successor, Jimmy Carter, failed to win reelection in 1980. The format varied: most of these amendments, particularly those introduced before the 1950s, proposed only a single six-year term for the President and Vice President, while others introduced since ratification of the Twenty-Second Amendment included provisions for its repeal. These \"lame duck\" sessions were increasingly criticized in the 20 th century, as they included Members of both chambers who had retired or had been defeated for reelection, and occasionally were dominated by political parties that had been repudiated at the November elections. The first session of most Congresses did not convene until more than a year after election day, and the second session, also known as the short session, usually convened after elections for its successor had been held, and continued through March 4. These \"lame duck\" sessions were",

The estimated average grant to territories was $3.40 million per fiscal year. The estimated average grant to territories was $3.40 million per fiscal year. For FY2018, Congress appropriated an amount necessary to cover the estimated long-term liability to the federal government of a Section 108 loan guarantee (credit subsidy). The Trump Administration did not request any new loan guarantee authority. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, P.L. 115-141, signed by the President on March 3, 2018, included $300 million in Section 108 loan guarantee authority. The authorizations of federal appropriations for these activities vary widely from $0.5 million to $25 million for planning and design assistance, to $0.2 million to $435 million for construction assistance. As with Reclamation's rural water supply and Title XVI projects, congressional funding of these authorizations has enlarged the scope of the agency's activities. The Administration has requested no new loan guarantee authority for EDA programs, including $30 million for salaries and expenses. The Administration is requesting $30 million for salaries and expenses. The Administration's FY2020 budget requests no new funding for EDA program activities but does request $30 million to cover the costs associated with closing down the agency. The statutory authority for the public works program is the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended, P.L. 89-136 (42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq. ). In terms of scope and mission, the primary responsibilities of USACE are to maintain inland navigation, provide for flood and storm damage reduction, and restore aquatic ecosystems, which makes Reclamation assistance a de facto long-term loan. USACE also has authorities related to water supply provision as part of emergency and disaster relief, including during droughts. For all of its projects, USACE policy is that it does not acquire water rights for these water supply and conservation uses; the water user is responsible for securing water rights. How USACE and nonfederal financing is managed varies according to the specifics of the authorization. For non-Indian rural water supply projects, Congress has authorized nonreimbursable federal funding of as much as 75%-85% of project costs. For non-Indian rural water supply projects, federal funding is required to fund the construction of infrastructure projects. For non-Indian rural water supply projects, USACE uses appropriated funds to financially assist by reimbursing nonfederal sponsors for their work. According to the most recent estimates by states and EPA, funding needs for projects eligible for CWSRF or DWSRF funding—described in the sections above (i.e., projects needed to address water quality and public health-related problems or regulations)—total $655 billion over a 20-year period. Approximately 90% of the work on the P.L. 534 projects is complete. For each of the projects and programs discussed, this report describes purposes, financing mechanisms, eligibility requirements, recent funding, and statutory/regulatory authority. The report does not address special projects This authority expired at the end of FY2016 and has not been renewed since. However, Reclamation continues to pursue authorized rural water projects that were previously authorized at the project level. As defined in Clean Water Act Section 212, devices and systems used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal sewage are eligible. These include construction or upgrading of secondary or advanced treatment plants; construction of new collector sewers, interceptor sewers, or storm sewers; and projects to correct existing problems of sewer system rehabilitation, infiltration/inflow of sewer lines, and combined sewer overflows. Operation and maintenance are not eligible activities. All funds in the clean water SRF resulting from federal capitalization grants are first to be used to assure compliance with enforceable deadlines, goals, and requirements of the act, including municipal compliance. Prior to enactment of the WIIN Act, funds may be used to provide credit assistance for a range of wastewater and drinking water projects. The first of two formulas uses population, overcrowded housing, and poverty data, while the second formula allocates funds based on an entitlement community's relative share of poverty, housing built before 1940, and the lag in population growth rate relative to the total for all entitlement communities. Similar formulas are used to allocate nonentitlement funds. The act, among other provisions, authorizes EPA to provide credit assistance for a range of wastewater and drinking water projects. Project costs must be $20 million or larger to be eligible for credit assistance. As a condition of receiving CDBG funds, an entitlement community must submit a consolidated plan at least 45 days before the beginning of its program year detailing the proposed use of funds over a five-year period. For FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $68 million for the WIFIA program, which has the",

  ", and continuing to develop the capabilities of SOF combat divers to the surface. This program will allow for the development of new underwater diving technologies for the SOF combat diver while conducting underwater, real-world missions. FY 2020 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures total of 10 divers' maritime environmental protection and diver navigation. Press Reports A November 30, 2016, press report states the following: USSOCOM is currently pursuing two programmes to enhance the sub-surface capabilities of US Navy (USN) SEALs including the Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) and Dry Combat Submersible (DCS). Both solutions are fully enclosed vehicles for operators, thereby reducing any requirement for teams to wear rebreathing equipment during mission insertions and extractions.... The main difference between SWCS and DCS is that SWCS and DCS are both fully enclosed vehicles for operators, thereby reducing any requirement for teams to wear rebreathing equipment during mission insertions and extractions.... The main difference between SWCS and DCS is range, with the latter solution providing a longer insertion distance with a greater depth capability. We will continue to maintain a forward-deployed presence around the world to prevent conflict, increase interoperability with our allies, enhance the maritime security and capacity of our traditional and emerging partners, and the preservation of the force and families. We will continue to maintain a high tempo of U.S. presence and influence globally and, when necessary, project power without a costly, sizeable, or permanent footprint ashore. We will continue to maintain a forward-deployed presence around the world to prevent conflict, increase interoperability with our allies, enhance the maritime security and capacity of our traditional and emerging partners, and the preservation of the force and families. We will continue to maintain a forward-deployed presence around the world to prevent conflict, increase interoperability with our allies, enhance the maritime security and capacity of our traditional and emerging partners, confront irregular challenges, and respond to crises. SOF sources associated with USSOCOM explained to IHS Jane's how the first SWCS could be delivered to the Command in 2017. This program element also provides for pre-acquisition activities to quickly respond to new requirements for SOF surface and undersea mobility. To continue as a global force in the preventive and responsive mission areas that confront irregular challenges, including those of irregular warfare, the Navy will be faced with increasing demand in a fiscally induced capacity constrained environment. Constrained capacity requires a prioritization of areas requiring persistent presence, to include those regions of current or forecast instability. Also required is an understanding of the risk incurred to mission, and to force, if we do not get that priority correct. We must ensure our Navy remains the finest, best trained, and most ready in the world to sustain key mission areas that support confronting irregular challenges. Operating in and from the maritime domain with joint and international partners, the Navy is enhancing regional security while dissuading, deterring, and when necessary, defeating irregular threats. The Navy acknowledges the complexity of the future security environment and Third, when conducting MIW, operating from a sea base offers advantages to NSW. However, due to the costs of such a practice, both NSW and the conventional Navy must also recognize that decisions regarding when and where to support sea basing of this sort need to be made carefully. To meet these challenges Admiral Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations, recently provided his Sailing Directions to our Navy emphasizing the mission to deter aggression and, if deterrence fails, to win our Nation's wars. SOCOM projects that nine submersible motherships—including North Carolina as a backup—will be available by the end of the year. The Navy in December 2010 established \"a community of interest [COI] to develop and advance ideas, collaboration and advocacy related to confronting irregular challenges. Simultaneously, we minimize pressure on the force by ensuring adequate access to the resources of our forces and our families. We expect the demand for these activities to increase in the future security environment as a capacity constrained Navy seeks to maintain access and presence. Emphasis on increased training and education will enable our continued readiness to effectively meet global demand. As demand for our Navy continues to grow, we continue to leverage our Maritime Strategy with our partners, the Marine Corps and Coast Guard. At 41 feet long, CCA is a global force provider of expeditionary combat service support and force protection capabilities to joint warfighting commanders. It is responsible for centrally managing the current and future readiness, resources, manning, training and equipping of a scalable, self-sustaining, integrated expeditionary force of active and reserve sailors. In contrast to those of NSW, conventional U.S. Navy capabilities to support IW might entail CMOs and related activities to a greater extent than direct action. Appendix E.

  "US in statute and expanded the committee's role in reviewing domestic consumption and government budget deficits. The current account deficit could be reduced by boosting domestic savings (i.e., reducing domestic consumption and government budget deficits) or reducing foreign investment (i.e., reducing borrowing from abroad). Realigning exchange rates through the depreciation of the dollar, or ensuring other countries are not intervening in the market to artificially devalue their currencies, is another means. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) administers the collection of tariffs at U.S. ports of entry—in 2016, CBP collected $32 billion in tariffs, just 1% of total federal revenue. Over the past 80 years, the United States used its tariff policy to encourage global trade liberalization toward various ends, such as increasing global trade, supporting global peace and economic prosperity, and opening markets for U.S. exports. Toward these ends, the United States has reduced or eliminated many of its tariffs through bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations and agreements (see above). Beginning in 1934, Congress began periodically authorizing the President to impose a four-year safeguard measure on imports of solar cells and a three-year safeguard on large residential washing machines.

Beginning in 1934, Congress began periodically authorizing the President to impose a four-year safeguard measure on imports of solar cells and a three-year safeguard on large residential washing machines. The United States participates in three major categories of trade agreements: Multilateral agreements are negotiated in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and include all WTO members. Thus upon accession to the WTO for countries like China (joined in 2001), Vietnam (2007), and Russia (2012) for example, PNTR had to concurrently be established under U.S. law for the United States to receive the full benefits of their membership. Overseas markets for exports provide opportunities for domestic firms to liberalize their trade and investment regimes, and thereby improve the efficiency of their economies. The U.S. trade is often called the \"national security clause,\" because it provides the President with the ability to impose low-tariff policies and has made greater use of its discretionary authority to increase tariffs on certain goods imported from key U.S. trading partners. U.S. trade laws include trade remedies used by the United States to mitigate the adverse impact of various foreign trade practices on domestic industries and workers. The The U.S. Trade Administration (ITA) is the official U.S. export credit agency. It provides \"level playing field\" against foreign firms that may be receiving subsidized financing from their governments. In addition, the U.S. trade policy has focused on supporting economic growth and jobs through trade, liberalizing markets by reducing trade and investment barriers through trade agreements and negotiations, enforcing trade commitments and related laws, and providing time-limited relief to companies and workers facing unfair or injurious import competition. Another key objective of U.S. trade policy has been to advance U.S. strategic goals by supporting economic development and integration of goods and services according to the country where that value was added. According to TiVA estimates, the U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if bilateral trade flows had been measured this way. The \"trade deficit\" generally is used to refer to three things: the balance of trade in goods, balance of trade in goods and services, and balance on the current account. The trade balance is the difference between U.S. consumption and imports of goods and services; this applies to each bilateral trading relationship, as well as to the aggregate across all trading partners. Despite its reauthorization, Ex-Im Bank has not been fully operational as its board of directors lacks a quorum due to unfilled positions, which has constrained the board's approval of medium- and long-term export financing above $10 million. More broadly, TPA defines how Congress is to exercise its constitutional authority over trade policy, while affording the President added negotiating credibility, by giving U.S. exporters an assurance that the final agreement will be considered by Congress in a timely manner and without amendments. Congress first enacted TPA under the Trade Act of 1974 and it must reflect the",

  "A filers make a certification for each patent listed in the Orange Book, recognizing that all contracts operate as a restraint on trade. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) further prohibits \"unfair methods of competition,\" —a category that includes (but is not limited to) conduct that violates the Sherman Act. When evaluating agreements for potential antitrust violations, the court focuses its inquiry on \"form[ing] a judgment about the competitive significance of the restraint... 'based either (1) on the nature or character of the contracts, or (2) on surrounding circumstances giving rise to the inference or presumption that they were intended to restrain trade and enhance prices.'\" The Supreme Court has recognized that \"reverse payment settlements... can sometimes violate the antitrust laws,\" and courts have allowed antitrust litigation challenging certain reverse payment settlements to proceed under existing law. In evaluating the reasonableness of contractual restraints on trade, courts have found that \"some agreements and practices are invalid per se, while others are illegal.\" In addition, courts have found that \"some agreements and practices are invalid per se, while others are illegal.\" In addition, courts have found that \"some agreements and practices are invalid per se, while others are illegal only as applied to particular situations.\" Courts generally apply a \"rule of reason\" analysis unless the agreement falls within a per se illegal category. However, courts use \"something of a sliding scale in appraising reasonableness\" and, in certain instances, apply a more abbreviated rule of reason analysis to an agreement, referred to as a \"quick look.\" Rule of Reason Analysis. While the Supreme Court has found that \"some agreements and practices are invalid per se, while others are illegal only as applied to particular situations.\" Courts generally apply a \"rule of reason\" analysis unless the agreement falls within a per se illegal category. In addition, courts use \"something of a sliding scale in appraising reasonableness\" and, in certain instances, apply a more abbreviated rule of reason analysis to an agreement, referred to as a \"quick look.\" Rule of Reason Analysis.

In addition, the Supreme Court has found that \"some agreements and practices are invalid per se, while others are illegal only as applied to particular situations.\" Rule of Reason Analysis. While the Supreme Court has not developed a \"canonical\" analytical framework to guide this totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry, most courts take a similar approach in resolving rule-of-reason cases. Under the standard approach, a Section 1 plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating that exclusive rights are necessary to provide incentives to produce new creative works and technological inventions. This rationale maintains that absent legal protections, competitors could freely copy such creations, denying the original creators the ability to recoup their investments in time and effort, and thereby reduce the incentive to create in the first place. IP incentives are said to be particularly necessary for products, such as pharmaceuticals, that are costly to develop but easily copied once marketed. Specifically, a patent thicket may describe the situation where The patentee, however, has the right to sue in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for \"reasonable and entire compensation\" for the government's use of the patented invention. In no event, however, will a court issue an injunction against the United States to prevent its use of the invention. In addition, Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act in 1983 to encourage the development of drugs and biologics to treat rare diseases and conditions. Because these drugs—called \"orphan drugs\" —often treat small patient populations and thus may provide fewer financial incentives for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop them, the law (among other measures) provides a seven-year marketing exclusivity for companies that obtain approval for these drugs. During the seven-year period, FDA cannot approve an NDA or BLA for the same drug or biological product would be shortened by an additional 30 days for each day that the patent application. The bill would authorize the Secretary to waive or decrease the reduction in the exclusivity period if (1) the manufacturer submits a report on the price increase that contains all the relevant information, and, (2) the Secretary determines that \"the price increase is necessary to enable production of the drug, does not unduly restrict patient access to the drug, and does not negatively impact public health.\" Examples of technological areas for patentable inventions include pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, computer hardware and software, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and manufacturing processes. Although the subject matter of patents is wide-ranging, the Supreme Court has long held that \"laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.\" The Court has reasoned that to permit a monopoly on the \"'basic tools of scientific and technological work'... might tend to impede innovation more than it has not been used recently in the pharmaceutical context.

The Director General is also to report that the United States would no longer participate in the Joint Cooperative Plan of Action (JCPOA) and would reimpose U.S. sanctions that had been suspended pursuant to the agreement. President Trump ordered Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to \"take all appropriate steps to cease the participation of the United States in the JCPOA,\" and, along with Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, to immediately \"begin taking steps to reimpose all United States sanctions lifted or waived in connection\" with the agreement. The United States has notified the other P5+1 states that it will no longer attend meetings of the Joint Commission, the working group concerning the Arak reactor, or the procurement working group, all of which were established pursuant to the JCPOA.

The Coast Guard is expected to award a contract for the second Polar Security Cutter (PSC). The ship is considered less an icebreaker than an ice-capable research ship. Summary Table A-1 summarizes the above six ships. Additionally, the Polar Star has required extensions of about 3 months for its annual dry dock periods—the period of time when a cutter is removed from the water so that maintenance can be conducted—in 2016 and 2017 to complete required maintenance activities. These dry docks were originally planned to last between 2-1/2 months and 4 months. The Coast Guard is able to significantly mature the acquisition approach with the incorporation of Industry Studies to identify solutions to minimize cost, schedule, production and technology risks. The ship, which completed construction in 2012, is owned by ECO and chartered by Royal Dutch Shell. It was reactivated on December 14, 2012.

The court thus held that the student had stated a claim sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. In another case, an accused student alleged that he was not given adequate notice of the scope of charges against him. Rather, the school only notified him that his conduct on a particular day was under review, but expelled him for sexual misconduct that occurred in relation to other incidents and dates. The federal district For example, the Sixth Circuit recently held that a student sufficiently pleaded a due process claim where he alleged that a university disciplinary hearing for alleged sexual assault was biased against him. In that case, one of the hearing panel members acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge. The court noted that that fact alone did not give rise to a due process violation. Rather, because that individual also allegedly dominated the panel with remarks intended to reduce the defendant's credibility, and reportedly said during the hearing, \"I'll bet you do this [commit sexual assault] all the time,\" the student had plausibly alleged that the hearing panel member was not impartial and had pre-judged his case. Courts have also addressed claims alleging a due process violation for bias based on institutional pressures, such as the sexual assault training received by university officials. Accordingly, a funding recipient is not liable under Title IX if it responds to sexual assault training that was not balanced with training. Accordingly, a funding recipient is not liable under Title IX if it responds to sexual abuse or harassment \"in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable.\" In addition, when a school allows parties to appeal a finding or remedy, it must do so for both parties.

  ". DOE issued an environmental assessment on January 17, 2019, that found no significant environmental impact from fabricating the fuel at existing INL facilities. According to the German government, \"By 2050 renewable energies should make up 60 percent of the gross final consumption of energy, and 80 percent of the gross electricity consumption.\" A 2017 study by an academic team developed \"roadmaps\" for 139 countries to convert to 100% renewable energy by 2050. Many advanced nuclear reactors would operate at higher temperatures (500-1,000°C) than existing commercial reactors (approximately 300-330°C). The Nuclear Energy Institute has estimated that it would take a minimum of seven years to establish the infrastructure to supply this fuel for commercial purposes. The United States is a major participant in the project. Fusion power would require light atoms, generally isotopes of hydrogen, to be heated to 100 million degrees to form a plasma, a state of matter in which electrons are stripped away from the atomic nucleus. Holding the plasma together while it is heated sufficiently to create a fusion reaction is a major technical challenge. ITER would do this with a powerful magnetic field, while other approaches would compress a pellet of hydrogen with lasers or other intense energy sources. Fusion reactions are routinely produced at the laboratory scale, but none of these reactions have yet achieved \"burning plasma,\" in which energy produced by fusion at least equals the energy needed to heat the plasma. A fusion power reactor would need to achieve \"ignition,\" in which the fusion energy itself would keep the plasma heated. ITER would do this with a powerful magnetic field, while other approaches would compress a pellet of hydrogen with lasers or other intense energy sources.

At high temperatures, lead tends to corrode structural steel. Achieving commercialization for designs in the higher temperature ranges would thus need further technological advances in corrosion-resistance for structural steel components coming into contact with the liquid lead coolant. Lead is also highly opaque, presenting visibility and monitoring challenges within the core, and very heavy, due to its high density. The high melting point of lead also presents challenges in terms of keeping the lead in liquid form so that it can continue to circulate under lower-temperature scenarios. Examples of U. Advanced reactor designs may be grouped into three primary categories: Advanced water- -energy is also working with DOE and others to develop the fuel technology that would be used in an HTGR pebble bed reactor. Other U.S. companies developing HTGRs include HolosGen and Hybrid Power Technologies. Gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs) would be high-temperature, closed fuel cycle fast reactors using helium as a primary coolant. In addition to the programs that focus exclusively on advanced reactor R&D, several cross-cutting NE programs directly or indirectly support advanced nuclear technologies. NE's Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) program includes several subprograms focused on cross-cutting research to support both existing and advanced nuclear technologies. Subprograms of NEET support DOE's Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative, which provides technical, financial, and regulatory support for existing and advanced nuclear technologies by providing enhanced access to DOE's network of national labs and unique nuclear R&D capabilities, as well as through competitive industry funding opportunities. GAIN industry funding opportunities include U.S. Industry Opportunities for Advanced Nuclear Technology Development, a five-year funding opportunity announcement initiated in December of 2017 that offers cost-sharing opportunities for advanced reactor development, demonstration, and regulatory assistance, and for other nuclear R&D. Applications are reviewed and awards are announced on a quarterly basis. DOE expects to award a total of $400 million over the five-year program.

  " of multiple parties pooling resources. Some of these analysts believe that OTs are appropriate for those cases where the \"regulations applicable to the allocation of patent and data rights under the procurement statutes may not be appropriate to partnership arrangements. Some observers argue that as the legislation on OTs has evolved, the cost-sharing provision for prototype projects has come to create an unfair playing field biased against traditional defense contractors. A number of analysts argue that using consortia in this way gives the federal government a unique ability to leverage and pool the technological expertise and innovation of multiple entities in a particular sector, thereby strengthening and advancing a sector of the industrial base that may have defense applications. This report examines (1) how OTs work, (2) why they were established, (3) potential benefits and risks of using OTs, and (4) whether there are data available against which to measure their effectiveness. Appendix A provides a legislative history of DOD's other transaction authorities. Section 827 established 10 U.S.C. 2358, which gave the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments the authority to conduct research, development, and implementation of new technologies.

Section 863 required training and education for personnel involved in OTs and other innovative contracting methods. Previously, OTs were only authorized for advanced research. Prototype Authorities Section 845 granted DARPA the authority to use OTs for prototype projects directly related to weapons or weapon systems proposed to be acquired by DOD. Section 845 defined a transaction for follow-on production to include \"all individual prototype sub-projects awarded under the transaction to a consortium of United States industry and academic institutions.\" Section 864 also increased the dollar thresholds for required approvals and defined the term small business to include small businesses under Section 9 of the Small Business Act to ensure that companies participating in the Small Business Act to ensure that companies participating in the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs were considered small businesses for the purposes of the cost-sharing requirements. Miscellaneous Section 867 required the Secretary of Defense to establish a preference for OTs in the \"execution of science and technology and prototyping programs.\" However, the report stated its concern \"with the lack of transparency on the use of OTA authority for follow-on production procurements,\" and directed that no funds could be obligated or expended for a follow-on production contract or a transaction carried out under 10 U.S.C. 2371b, until 30 days after the Secretary of Defense provides the congressional defense committees with a notification of the proposed contract or transaction, to include a justification of why an OT is being used for production. Appendix B. Non-DOD Federal Agencies with Agency-Wide OT or Related Authorities A number of agencies have varying other transaction or similar authorities, as reflected in Table B-1. The table below is not a comprehensive or definitive listing of every federal government entity with OT or related authorities.

Many Caribbean countries also have suffered high rates of violent crime, including murder, often associated with drug trafficking activities. President Trump unveiled a new policy toward Cuba in June 2017 increasing sanctions and partially rolling back some of the Obama Administration's efforts to normalize relations. The most significant changes in the U.S. policy toward Cuba were the following: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a series of partnerships with other countries in the region: the Mérida Initiative, which has led to improved bilateral security cooperation with Mexico; the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI); and the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI). Under the Obama Administration, those initiatives combined U.S. antidrug and rule-of-law assistance with economic development and violence prevention programs intended to improve citizen security in the region. The Trump Administration has maintained the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America while seeking to enact some significant changes in U.S. policy toward the region. In March 2018, Peru and the other 10 signatories of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (minus the United States, which withdrew in 2017) signed a new trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Vizcarra is continuing the same types of market-friendly economic policies as his recent predecessors. These three pillars have been long-standing U.S. policy objectives in Latin America and the Caribbean. These three pillars have been long-standing U.S. policy objectives in Latin America and the Caribbean, and they match up with three of the Obama Administration's four policy priorities for the region. The Northern Triangle nations also depend on energy imports and, over the past decade, have placed a greater emphasis on security concerns. As noted above (\" Migration Issues \"), the Administration also has implemented a series of immigration policy changes that affect Central Americans living in the region—economic growth and prosperity, security, and democratic governance. These three pillars have been long-standing U.S. policy objectives in Latin America and the Caribbean, and they match up with three of the Obama Administration's four policy priorities for the region (with the exception of securing a clean energy future). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed a number of measures to reduce poverty and instability in the region. The Northern Triangle countries, with U.S. support, have made some tentative progress over the past three years. They have implemented some policy changes intended to stabilize their economies, but the improved macroeconomic situation has yet to translate into better living conditions for many residents since the governments have not invested in effective poverty-reduction programs. In December 2018, the Venezuelan election, boycotted by most opposition parties, was significantly flawed. In addition, Cuba underwent a political transition in April, when Raúl Castro stepped down from power and Cuba's legislature selected a new president. (See Table 1 for a listing of leaders and elections.) Despite significant improvements in political rights and civil liberties, many countries in the region still face considerable challenges. In a number of countries, the United States provided almost $23 million in humanitarian funding to six Caribbean countries and 115-141 ), provided $6 million for CICIG and $31 million for MACCIH and the Northern Triangle's attorneys general. Cocaine exports, primarily to the U.S. market, remain a concern for U.S. lawmakers, despite Colombia's economic stability and improving security, in part due to the demobilization of about 11,000 former FARC. Key issues in the U.S.-Colombian relationship are implementing the Colombian government's peace accord with the FARC; fighting organized crime, which has flared since the FARC demobilized; and reducing corruption. In March 2017, the Senate passed S.Res. 83, a resolution calling for U.S. support for Mexico's efforts to combat fentanyl. In December 2017, the government held a referendum on measures to reduce public corruption that barely missed its threshold and did not pass. The U.S. and Colombian governments have joint efforts to address the spike in assassinations of social leaders and human rights defenders and to more effectively combat cocaine production. In meetings between President Duque and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in early January 2019, the two partners discussed cooperation on counternarcotics, peace accord implementation, and trade, and Pompeo vowed U.S. assistance to Colombia aimed at decreasing coca production by 50% by 2023. Congressional Action: In May 2017, Congress enacted a FY2017 omnibus appropriations measure ( P.L. 115-31 ) that funded programs in Colombia at $391.3 million. The House version also would have continued a provision from FY2018, which allowed the Haitian government to purchase U.S. defense articles and services for its Coast Guard.

In addition, some of the world's largest economies, including China, India, and Brazil, may justify developing country status because their per capita incomes more closely resemble those of a developing country than those of developed countries. In the last four rounds of negotiations, WTO members aimed to expand international trade rules beyond tariff reductions to tackle barriers in other areas. For example, agreements on technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures aim to protect a country's rights to implement domestic regulations and standards, while ensuring they do not discriminate against trading partners or unnecessarily restrict trade. In the last four rounds of negotiations, WTO members aimed to expand international trade rules beyond tariff reductions to tackle barriers in other areas. For example, interpretations of the WTO agreements and country waivers from certain provisions require a three-fourths affirmative vote for some matters, while a two-thirds affirmative vote is required for an amendment to an agreement. The United States filed its own WTO complaints over retaliatory tariffs imposed by five countries (Canada, China, EU, Mexico, and Turkey) in response to U.S. actions, and in late August, it filed a similar case against Russia.

The United States and other WTO members have used dispute settlement procedures on a number of occasions to address China's alleged noncompliance with certain WTO commitments. As a respondent, China accounts for about 12% of total WTO disputes since 2001. The United States has brought 23 dispute cases against China at the WTO on issues, including IPR protection, subsidies, and discriminatory industrial policies, and has largely WTO members committed to intensify WTO negotiations, \"with a view to adopting\" an agreement by the next Ministerial; the United States has supported these efforts. A joint statement was issued by 60 members in support of advancing multilateral negotiations on domestic regulations in services. Subsets of WTO members also issued statements committing to new work programs or open-ended talks for interested parties to potentially conclude plurilateral agreements. The United States expounded on some of the perceived shortcomings of the dispute settlement system in its most recent trade policy agenda. In addition, the GATS was not thought to provide much actual liberalization, as many countries simply did not want to participate in the WTO. In addition, services negotiations during Doha also succumbed to the resistance of developing countries to open their markets in response to developed country demands, as well as dissatisfaction with other aspects of the single undertaking. The GATT—called the \"Decision on Differential and More Favorable Treatment, Reciprocity and Other Nonreciprocity and Other Nonreciprocity\" (TRIPS Article 73) is a multilateral trade agreement that is based on the principles of the WTO. The GATT is a multilateral trade agreement that is based on the principles of the WTO. The \"Decision on Differential and More Favorable Treatment, Reciprocity and Other Nonreciprocity and Other Nonreciprocity of Participation of Developing Countries\" of 1979—enables developed country members to grant differential and more favorable treatment to developing countries that is not extended to other members. For example, this permits granting unilateral and nonreciprocal trade preferences to developing countries under special programs, such as the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and also relates to regional trade agreements outside the WTO (see below).

The United States has employed various sanctions in response to concerns about the deterioration of human rights and democratic conditions in Venezuela and the lack of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts. U.S. officials have expressed increasing concerns regarding the deterioration of human rights and democratic conditions in Venezuela. U.S. democracy and human rights funding, which totaled $15 million in FY2018, and political support have bolstered democratic civil society in Venezuela. U.S. humanitarian assistance is supporting Venezuelans who have fled to neighboring countries. Foro Penal and Human Rights Watch have documented several cases in which those accused of plotting coups were subjected to \"beatings, asphyxiation and electric shocks\" by the intelligence services The October 2018 death of Fernando Albán, an opposition politician who was also in custody for his reported involvement in the August 2018 alleged assassination attempt, has provoked domestic protests and massive emigration. In the wake of the May 2018 elections that the United States and much of the international community deemed illegitimate, the Trump Administration has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro government in order to hasten a return to democracy in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has ratcheted up targeted sanctions on Venezuelan officials accused of corruption, antidemocratic actions, or human rights abuses under Executive Order (E.O.) 13692 (issued by President Obama in 2015) and on Venezuela-linked individuals and entities for drug trafficking. The election of former President Rafael Caldera (1969-1974) as president in December 1993 brought a measure of political stability, but the government faced a severe banking crisis. A rapid decline in the price of oil caused a recession beginning in 1998, which contributed to Chávez's landslide election. A rapid decline in the price of oil caused a recession beginning in 1998, which contributed to Chávez's landslide election. Under Chávez, Venezuela adopted a new With a simple majority, the legislature can approve or reject the budget and the issuing of debt, remove ministers and the vice president from office, overturn enabling laws that give the president executive powers, and appoint the 5 members of the CNE (for 7-year terms) and the 32 members of the Supreme Court (for one 12-year term). With a two-thirds majority, the assembly can remove judges, submit laws directly to a popular referendum, and convene a constitutional assembly to revise the constitution. The Maduro government has continued to count on political support from Cuba, Bolivia, and Nicaragua, which, together with Venezuela, were key members of the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (ALBA), a group launched by President Chávez in 2004. The government's policy responses to the economic crisis—even with the new reforms in August—have been widely criticized as inadequate. The government appears loathe to adopt policies widely viewed by economists as necessary to restoring the economy: removing price controls, creating an independent central bank, engaging with an IMF program, and restructuring its debt with private bondholders. According to the White House, the measures \"are carefully calibrated to deny the Maduro dictatorship a critical source of financing to maintain its illegitimate rule, protect the U.S. financial system from complicity in Venezuela's corruption and in the impoverishment of the Venezuelan people, and allow for humanitarian assistance.\" Sanctions targeting sovereign debt are unusual, but not unprecedented.

  ". While the First Amendment does not apply to all forms of speech, it does not apply to all forms of speech, it does not apply to all forms of speech, it does not apply to all forms of speech, it does not apply to all forms of speech, it does not apply to all forms of speech, it does not apply to all forms of speech, it does not apply to all forms of speech. The extent of any free speech protections will depend on how courts view social media companies and the specific action being regulated. Accordingly, the bulk of this report explores how the First Amendment applies to social media providers' content presentation decisions. Looking to three possible analogues drawn from existing First Amendment law, the report explores whether social media companies \"materially contribute[d] to the illegality\" of the disputed content, or \"in some way specifically encourage[d] development of what is offensive about the content.\" Thus, for example, a federal appellate court concluded that Roommates.com, a site that \"match[ed] people renting out spare rooms with people looking for a place to live,\" was not wholly immune from claims that it had violated laws prohibiting housing discrimination. The court concluded that Roommates.com could be subject to suit for discrimination because the site required all users to respond to questions about their sex, family status, and sexual orientation by selecting among preset answers to those questions, and to state their \"preferences in roommates with respect to the same three criteria.\" Accordingly, in the court's view, as to these questions and answers, Roommates.com was not wholly immune from claims that it had violated laws prohibiting housing discrimination. The court concluded that Roommates.com could be subject to suit for discrimination because the site required all users to respond to questions about their sex, family status, and sexual orientation by selecting among preset answers to those questions, and to state their \"preferences in roommates with respect to the same three criteria.\" Accordingly, in the court's view, as to these questions and answers, Roommates.com was not wholly immune from the First Amendment. The court's view, as to these questions and answers. The Court's view, as to these questions and answers, Roommates.com is not wholly immune from the First Amendment. The Court's view, as to these questions and answers, Roommates.com was \"more than a passive transmitter of information provided by others; it becomes the developer, at least in part, of that information.\" As discussed above, courts have often dismissed lawsuits attempting to hold social media providers liable for publishing information that was created by an \"information content provider,\" effectively protecting social media sites from liability for hosting content. By contrast, Section 230(c)(2) provides immunity for sites that take good faith action to restrict access to content, at least some of which entail hosting—and creating—constitutionally protected speech. Social media companies have recognized their role in providing platforms for speech. To take one example, in a September 2018 hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, repeatedly referred to Twitter as a \"digital public square,\" noting that the company \"did not participate in the operation or management of the social media sites, but only used these sites.\" The Court noted that the government did not participate \"in the operation or management of defendants' websites,\" but only used these sites \"in the same manner as other users.\" Accordingly, lower courts have uniformly concluded that the First Amendment does not prevent a shopping center from banning the distribution of handbills. However, the Supreme Court has not yet weighed in on this subject, and as will be discussed in more detail below, a number of legal commentators have argued that, notwithstanding these trial court decisions, courts should view social media platforms as equivalent to state actors, at least when they perform certain functions. A constitutional injury is not the only type of harm that a social media user might suffer as a result of a social network's decisions about user content, and litigants have brought a wide variety of claims challenging these sorts of decisions. For example, in United States v. X-Citement Video, the Court noted that, with respect to a federal law prohibiting the distribution of child pornography, criminal liability turned on \"the age of the performers\"—as did First Amendment protection for the materials, given that \"nonobscene, sexually explicit materials involving persons over the age of 17 are protected by the First Amendment.\" Accordingly, although the statute was unclear on this point, the Court held that the law applied only if a person distributing such materials knew that the performers were underage. Even if a statute does target a category of speech that is traditionally proscribable, it may still be invalid if it is overbroad, in the sense that it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech, as well. Thus, for example, in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, decided in 1997, does not specifically address government regulation of modern social media"
