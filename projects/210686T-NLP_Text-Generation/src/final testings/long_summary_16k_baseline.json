According to NNSA documents, NNSA is still developing the technology and intend to create a new cost estimate.

NNSA’s program to develop LEU to be developed by NNSA, and NNSA’s program to develop LEU to be developed by NNSA, according to NNSA documents. According to NNSA documents, NNSA has preliminarily identified the two remaining uranium enrichment technologies as the most feasible options to supply unobligated LEU, which is subject to a peaceful use provision in an international agreement between the United States and Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. According to NNSA documents, the cost estimates are preliminary and are intended only to be developed by NNSA, and NNSA is developing more in-depth cost estimates as NNSA progresses further in the analysis of LEU and LEU. According to NNSA documents, NNSA may be missing opportunities to consider options for providing additional enriched uranium that do not entail reestablishing a uranium enrichment plant. According to NNSA documents, and we identified one additional risk, facing the DBOT program. According to NNSA’s October 2015 plan identified the uncertainty of annual appropriations in the amount of $770 million to support this program. According to NNSA’s October 2015 plan identified a second risk associated with the availability of material for the program. The second most feasible option to supply unobligated LEU for tritium production is the design for a small centrifuge technology. NNSA has adhered to this policy and used only unobligated LEU and the dates when it will be available are subject to some uncertainty. According to a September 2015 DOE memorandum, the department had obtained the testing data it needed and determined that there was “minimal incremental value” in the United States. There is",

In a May 2018 report, the HUD OIG stated that the grantees had developed a staffing plan to address long-term oversight and management of the CDBG-DR program and, as of March 1, 2019, expected to fill 14 positions over the next 3 months. In addition, the HUD OIG recommended that HUD continue to fill its vacancies and assess staffing resources as it prepared for additional disaster funds. HUD also stated that grantees have the discretion to use allocated funds to assist applicants with less severe damage as long as those individuals have unmet needs. As a result, the final report is a good first step, HUD still needs to conduct workforce planning to determine if the number of staff they will be able to hire is sufficient to oversee the growing number of CDBG-DR grants. As discussed above, HUD officials told us that HUD officials did not address all key requirements for CDBG-DR grants, but in the absence of additional guidance for staff, it was unclear how they determine that documents are adequate. In addition, in a May 2018 report on CDBG-DR program would allow HUD to assess the grantees’s requirements for CDBG-",

In addition, the program has begun to take steps towards development of a joint workforce plan that assesses workforce and training needs, such as in cases where the inspectors are not familiar with certain techniques or equipment being used in a registered laboratory.

DOD has realigned the Secretary of the Army as the DOD Executive Agent for the BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program. According to DOD, the Secretary of the Army’s 2017 Annual Report to Congress, the realignment of the BioTesting Division will enable tracking, reporting, and meeting of audit requirements within an approved framework for managing BSAT. In October 2015, the Army has developed measures to ensure that its biological test and evaluation mission remains independent under its biological research and development mission. The Army has taken multiple types of actions—including operational, administrative, and personnel actions—to implement the recommendations from the report. We asked DOD to characterize the relative priority of the recommendations and describe those actions that have been taken or are under way. DOD reported that 12 recommendations were considered “high” priority, 7 of these being assessed as implemented and 5 as in progress, 18 recommendations were considered “moderate” priority, and",

However, MDA has not had an opportunity to fully assess the memorandum and the process laid out in it. As a result of the delay in conducting a test for production-readiness, the program is currently planning to be complete by late fiscal year 2016. However, MDA has continued to provide warranty-like support in areas such as water supply, seismic-activity certification, and compatible electrical systems. MDA has entered into 11 undefinitized contract actions. Although, as noted above, MDA is also responsible for analyzing the extent to which the threat model, once it is applied to the ground testing framework, can be traced back to the threat model that MDA developed and the intelligence community’s description of the threat. In addition, MDA has chosen not to reschedule and has instead re-assigned SFTM-02’s objectives to FTM-29. MDA provides these baselines in response to statutory requirements. The Director, MDA should revise MDA policies to require that all integrated capabilities—capabilities that require integration of two or more elements—be included in a Technical Capability Declaration. Specifically, MDA’s efforts to develop additional capabilities for operational assessment is, in most cases, not completed in time to support testing. These reports contain some information on undefinitized contracts. However, the information is often inconsistently presented and distributed throughout the report.

As with total pay, the instructional pay disparity for full-time contingent faculty in Ohio is larger if all faculty are included. In addition to these interviewed and non-interviewed households from the basic CPS monthly sample, the ASEC includes additional households; the total sample size for the 2016 ASEC was almost 100,000 households. The ASEC provides supplemental data for the faculty and contingent faculty. For example, when we analyzed national data, we found that contingent faculty and contingent faculty declined slightly; however, the number of contingent faculty and contingent faculty may not have the same opportunities to develop professional networks or conduct research in their field. In addition, we conducted two additional discussion groups with contingent faculty who taught at multiple institutions. In addition, while each state dataset was structured slightly differently, used different variable names, and contained some unique elements or ways of capturing information about faculty or courses, we restructured and compiled the information to provide consistency across the states. In terms of faculty types, we found that contingent faculty and contingent faculty declined. In addition, we did not have the same opportunities to develop professional networks.

We did not have the same opportunities to apply for tenure-track positions. We used data from several institutions to compare annual earnings across different types of faculty. In addition, we did not allow us to determine the exact nature of graduate assistant positions in the SDR data or explain how they compare to other types of positions. We also chose not to present estimated percentages for part-time contingent faculty. We also chose not to present estimated percentages for part-time tenure-track faculty given that they represented a small proportion of their position. While full-time contingent faculty may have a variety of responsibilities, administrators stated that part-time contingent faculty generally focus on teaching, though they also may fulfill different purposes. In some cases, part-time contingent faculty have a large number of faculty positions, as compared to full-time contingent faculty. In other cases, we found that contingent faculty have a large number of faculty positions, as compared to full-time faculty. We identified the highest level 2-digit CIP code for each faculty member in all three state datasets. In addition, while some part-time contingent faculty declined, we",

In addition, OMB staff noted that it is the agencies’ responsibility to provide a broad set of actions that agencies must take to manage fraud risks, regardless of whether the fraud risk is identified as an enterprise risk. The need for this coordination underscores the importance of identifying financial and administrative controls. However, the agencies did not have sufficient information on the financial and administrative controls, as required by FRDAA. In addition, OMB staff stated that they instructed agencies to provide a status update of fraud risk management practices, as required by FRDAA, and did not provide agencies with any specific guidance on how detailed that reporting should be in their annual financial reports. The Standards for Internal Control state that management should implement control activities through policies and documentation and externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the fraud risk management practices outlined in the FRDAA. As examples of these recent reforms, in March 2017 the President issued an executive order requiring a proposed plan to implement fraud risk management activities.",

We found that the market for acquiring projects and attracting investor capital is highly competitive. We found that the per-unit cost of projects were more than $50,000 higher than for construction projects. As a result, we were not able to compare construction costs for projects in New York City to construction costs. We also found that construction costs were less likely to be funded by other sources. We also provided a draft to NCHSA for its review and comment. For example, HUD collects and periodically reports information on LIHTC projects. We found that developers generally are expected to report those costs on the legal or partnership line item. As a result, we were unable to report information on LIHTC projects. This information generally took the form of whether a project received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, a component of which is required. We found that LIHTC projects were more likely to be funded by other sources. We found that the federal funding sources in addition to LIHTC projects were associated with cost differences, after controlling for other characteristics. We found that a number of organizations that developed LIHTC projects were less likely to be funded by other sources. We found that LIHTC projects were associated with lower per-unit cost (typically 15 percent, although percentages ranged from 8 percent to 20 percent), while two others had dollar caps ($13,000 and $18,000 per unit). We believe that general contractor cost certifications should be required to help ensure the efficient and effective use of federal resources. We found that LIHTC projects were more likely to be funded by other sources, including for project cost assessments. Individual allocating agencies could use data to more effectively identify cost drivers and trends over time. We have discussed how certain project characteristics were associated with higher and lower per-unit costs. We found that LIHTC projects might be expected to have higher costs as they generate more rent revenue to support higher development costs. We found that additional cost certification requirements would not significantly increase project costs.",

Additionally, the EAC and the NIST conducted a survey of jurisdictions in the United States. We estimate that the requirements are complicated, onerous, and time-consuming and they discourage vendors from making modifications to their voting systems even though the modifications might improve the systems.

We previously found that the program was on track to meet the cost and schedule goals in 2017. DHS is responsible for assessing the cost and schedule goals in its current acquisition program baseline (APB) because the program did not receive the funding needed to complete planned deployments on time to achieve its full operational capability (FOC) date of September 2020. The program’s FOC date previously slipped 5 years because of delays in the program. DHS is responsible for developing a number of requirements documents—including an operational requirements document—to fully validate the findings. As of September 2017, the program delayed final deployment of ACE functionality several times and missed the deadlines for completing the remaining milestones in its current acquisition program baseline (APB), including achieving acquisition decision event (GAO",

In addition, in January 2018, the program has determined that, to meet its original target dates, GMM needs to provide additional information about the requirements of the program. In addition, in January 2018, the agency had to develop another system in 2017 to supplement EMMIE with additional grant tracking and information capabilities. In addition, in August 2018, the agency had to develop another system in 2017 to supplement EMMIE with additional grant tracking and information capabilities. In October 2018, FEMA has begun planning its business process reengineering activities, which occurred from January to June 2018. These gaps in tracking the progress of requirements, in part, had an impact on the program’s progress. In addition, the program’s planning to ensure that the appropriate security controls are selected for the program’s programs. In addition, this document is intended to help avoid uncertainty and confusion among stakeholders as changes are made to the agency’s grant programs, and ensure successful adoption of new business processes, strategies, and technologies. In addition, the program utilized NIST guidance to select standard controls for a system categorized with a moderate-impact security level. These control areas include, for example, access controls, risk assessment, incident response, identification and authentication, and is regularly updated so that it always reflects the program’s current status. In addition, the program documented its planned actions to implement each control in its System Security Plan. For example, in 2016, the program had not created any corrective action plans for all of the systems that were classified as “Secret” or “Top Secret,” thus limiting its ability to ensure that all identified cybersecurity weaknesses were mitigated in a timely manner. In addition, as of September 2018, the program had not established a comprehensive analysis of the requirements of the program. In addition, the agency’s Office of Risk Management and Budget reviewed the requirements of the program. In addition, the officials were unable to provide time frames for completing the requirements,",

According to the two Oregon county prosecutors we interviewed, from late 2014 through 2017, their offices accepted about 141 of the more than 700 firearms denial investigations referred to their offices, with most prosecuted successfully. For example, a prosecutor in one field division stated that warning notices were used for firearms denials, but there was no field division policy to investigate firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials. Officials from all of the six selected field divisions said that, in light of the high volume and time-intensiveness of denial cases, they have taken various steps to reduce the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials, or the number of firearms denials. According to OSP officials, potential state level criminal conduct associated with firearms denials has increased from about 770 in 2011 to around 1,700 in 2016 and 2017. According to a Pennsylvania state police official, in some instances the charges are pled down to a lesser violation, such as disorderly conduct, which result in an approximately $300 fine. The two Pennsylvania prosecutors we interviewed said that most denial prosecutions in their jurisdictions are pled down to misdemeanors, which is when an individual may be referred to a state prosecutor. If the U.S. Attorney decides to prosecute, an arrest is made or a warrant is issued. The prosecutors also stated that these guidelines should place particular emphasis on cases against violent persons, including—but not limited to—denials involving individuals convicted of violent felonies, and may offer little value to public safety because the offender does not obtain the firearm, compared to other cases. In the state of Oregon, the investigation, the subject was not cooperative, and had an extensive criminal history in multiple states dating back 35 years, including several contacts with law enforcement, and to estimate the approximate quantity of these cases. In some states, the subject was charged with falsifying a background check form, to which he pled guilty and was sentenced to 12 months in prison. An individual under indictment for armed criminal action committed first-degree robbery in which he used a firearm. During the investigation, the subject received a criminal history record check. The subject later attempted to purchase a firearm and was able to obtain the firearm as a result of a delayed denial. According to the federal level, the number of firearms denials, which is difficult to conduct given the amount of documentation needed for prosecution when they have other duties. After a trooper completes an investigation, they submit a report to the District Attorney’s office. The number of delayed denials referred to ATF field divisions for investigation increased by 46 percent (from 2,742 to 3,993). This increase was driven by cases in which the prohibiting category was drug-related, which increased by about 300 referrals (60 percent increase); involved misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, which increased by about 250 referrals (34 percent increase); and involved felony convictions.

In the citation, OSHA found that the federal government is missing out on a cost-effective opportunity to develop a permissible exposure limit (PEL), a type of workplace safety and health standard that officials said would enable the agency to more easily cite employers for exposing their workers to peracetic acid hazards, compared to using the general duty clause. OSHA has not been able to expand its inspections in any of these cases. In particular, OSHA officials said that some meat and poultry workers may be less likely to report or seek treatment for injuries and illnesses because of their vulnerable status as undocumented or foreign-born workers and because of their economic vulnerability.

As Colombia's security situation improved and Colombia's economy recovered, the United States also began turning over to Colombians operational and financial responsibility for efforts formerly funded by the U.S. government.

In his victory statement, Akinci reiterated his campaign position that the status of the relationship between Turkey and Greek Cypriots should be respected, while the Greek Cypriots would not be able to resolve the Cyprus problem. The Turkish Cypriots announced that he would not seek reelection in 2013, stating that \"there are no reasonable hopes for a solution to the Cyprus problem or for substantial further progress in the remaining months of our presidency.\" After several days of talks, little movement was achieved. It was reported that the Turkish Cypriots would not be bound by any previous convergences discussed between his predecessor Christofias and Eroglu and would not agree to any definitive timetable to conclude the talks. While both sides blamed the other for a lack of progress on an agreement, the reaction to the talks appeared to be muted among both the political leaders and the Turkish Cypriots who wanted a comprehensive agreement. When the talks resumed on January 11, 2010, after three sessions the talks seemed to have reached a standstill, with the gap between the positions of the Turkish Cypriots and the talks, even at the technical level, would not continue at the same pace. In agreeing to the terms of the negotiations, the Turkish Cypriots insisted that the negotiations could not continue. Anastasiades and Talat concluded on March 30, 2010, and both sides accepted the fact that the negotiations would not resume. In January 2013, the Turkish Cypriots, however, rejected the Greek Cypriot territorial demand and insisted that Turkey's security role in the north be preserved; Greece insisted that Turkey's security role end. Some observers attributed this \"hands-off\" approach by Turkey as a reason why a positive atmosphere had surrounded the talks and why some of the Turkish Cypriots had left the meeting. Both sides blamed each other for the lack of progress. Anastasiades, however, was already under pressure from his coalition partner, DIKO, and former coalition partner, Eroglu, not to issue such a statement, which could not return to the table until the end of 2016.
