  " interstate agents, PHMSA regional officials stated that they needed interstate agents to supplement their current allocation of federal inspectors. For instance, in one region, PHMSA officials said that if interstate agent agreements were discontinued, the region would need to hire 3 to 4 additional inspectors. In another region, officials said that interstate agents provided the equivalent of 5 to 10 additional inspectors. Officials in one PHMSA region said that, although the region could absorb the interstate agent workload if needed, doing so would lead to less extensive inspections because there would more pipelines to inspect with fewer federal inspectors. Interstate agents may also enhance pipeline safety oversight within their state by going above and beyond the annual inspection activities required under their agreement with PHMSA. Specifically, as part of the annual inspection planning process, PHMSA’s regional offices work with interstate agents to develop an annual inspection plan. While interstate agents must prioritize PHMSA’s inspection priorities, such as participation in new construction inspections and PHMSA-led systems inspections, they can also propose additional inspections of interstate pipelines. At the federal level, PHMSA is responsible for developing regulations for domestic interstate and intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. Its regulatory programs are focused on ensuring safety in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of pipelines.

At the federal level, PHMSA is responsible for developing regulations for domestic interstate and intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. Its regulatory programs are focused on ensuring safety in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of pipelines. Inspectors from PHMSA’s five regional offices and states are responsible for inspecting nearly 3,000 miles of pipelines. Each year, PHMSA uses its Risk Ranking Index Model (RRIM) as one input to determine its annual inspection priorities. Each year, PHMSA uses its Risk Ranking Index Model (RRIM) as one input to determine its annual inspection priorities, they can also propose additional inspections of interstate pipelines within their state. Officials in half of the nine states with interstate agent agreements stated that they proposed and obtained PHMSA’s approval for additional pipeline inspections that would not otherwise have been included in PHMSA’s annual inspection plan. For instance, PHMSA’s Western Region reported that between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016 Washington State’s pipeline safety agency—which holds an interstate agent agreement—proposed and conducted 13 inspections beyond those identified in PHMSA’s inspection plans. During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. Some violations, including the four illustrative examples below, were deemed serious enough that PHMSA imposed civil penalties. In 2015, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection inspected an interstate pipeline that was deemed unsafe.

In 2015, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection inspected an interstate pipeline that was deemed unsafe by PHMSA. PHMSA officials we spoke with noted that the role of state inspectors can vary based on the levels of training and knowledge among state inspectors. PHMSA officials told us they intend to clarify this role for states. From fiscal year 2012 to 2017, PHMSA’s funding increased by nearly 40 percent, allowing the agency to hire additional pipeline inspectors. In the past 7 years, four additional state pipeline safety agencies have applied for interstate agent agreements. New Hampshire: In 2014, the state legislature passed a law requiring the state’s pipeline safety agency to apply for interstate agent status on an annual basis. State pipeline safety officials cited New Hampshire inspectors’ local knowledge of interstate pipelines, as well as concerns over the frequency of PHMSA’s interstate pipeline inspection activity, as reasons for seeking an agreement. To date, PHMSA has not accepted the state agency’s annual applications for interstate agent status citing an increase in the federal inspection workforce, a preference for states to focus on intrastate pipeline inspections, and a preference for states to focus on intrastate pipeline inspections. To date, PHMSA has not accepted the state agency’s annual applications for interstate agent status citing an increase in the federal inspection workforce, a preference for states to focus on intrastate pipeline oversight, and the ability for state agencies to participate in interstate inspections through other means, such as temporary interstate agreements.

  "VA’s mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans in recognition of their service to the nation by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials. In carrying out this mission, the department operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the United States, providing health care services to approximately 9 million veterans throughout the United States, Philippines, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. In 2015, we designated VA health care as a high-risk area for the federal government, and we continue to be concerned about the department’s ability to ensure that its resources are being used cost-effectively and efficiently to improve veterans’ timely access to health care. In part, we identified limitations in the capacity of VA’s existing IT systems, including the outdated, inefficient nature of certain systems and a lack of system interoperability as contributors to the department’s challenges related to health care. In part, we identified other VistA- related technology investments, such as VistA- related technology investments, such as networks and infrastructure sustainment, continuation of legacy systems, and overall patient safety, security, and system reliability. Table 1 provides a summary of the total VistA and related obligations that VA identified for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. Understanding the scope of VA’s current health information system is essential to effectively planning for the new system. However, according to VA officials, there is no single information source that fully defines the scope of VistA.

Table 1 provides a summary of the total VistA and related obligations that VA identified for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. Understanding the scope of VA’s current health information system is essential to effectively planning for the new system. However, according to VA officials, there is no single information source that fully defines the scope of VistA. Instead, existing definitions of VistA, including the components that comprise VistA are used to determine the scope of VistA. VistA has been essential to the department’s ability to deliver health care to veterans. VistA contains an electronic health record for each patient that supports clinical settings throughout the department. For example, clinicians can use the system to enter and review patient information; order lab tests, medications, diets, radiology tests, and procedures; record a patient’s allergies or adverse reactions to medications; request and track consults; enter progress notes, diagnoses, and treatments for encounters; and enter discharge summaries. VistA was developed in house by clinicians and IT personnel in various VA medical facilities and has been in operation since the early 1980s. Over the last several decades, VistA has evolved into a technically complex system comprised of about 170 modules that support health care delivery at 152 VA Medical Centers and over 1,200 outpatient sites. In addition, VistA contains an electronic health record for each patient that supports clinical settings throughout the department. VistA has been essential to the department’s ability to deliver health care to veterans. The identification of such site specific customization is intended to help Cerner plan for implementation of its system at each location. Our experience has shown that challenges can successfully be overcome through using a disciplined approach to IT acquisition management.

  " integration and testing is the phase in which problems are most likely to be found and schedules tend to slip. For a uniquely complex project such as JWST, this risk is magnified. Now that the project is well into its complex integration and test efforts, events are sequential in nature and there are fewer opportunities to mitigate issues in parallel. As shown in the figure below, Northrop Grumman’s work on the spacecraft element remains on the project’s critical path—the schedule with the least amount of reserve, which determines the overall schedule reserve for the project—now with an estimated 1.5 months of schedule reserve to the end of the launch window in June 2019. Given several ongoing technical issues, and the work remaining to test the spacecraft element and complete integration of the telescope and spacecraft, combined with continuing slower than planned work at Northrop Grumman, we believe that the rescheduled launch window is likely unachievable.

For the past 44 months, Northrop Grumman’s actual workforce has exceeded its projections and the company is not expected to significantly reduce its workforce until the spring of 2019, when NASA plans to ship the completed observatory to the launch site. Additionally, the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The hardware configuration created when the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module were integrated, referred to as OTIS, is not considered an element by NASA, but we categorize it as such for ease of discussion. Additionally, JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope, and to collect and transmit data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts. See figure 1 for an interactive graphic that depicts the elements and major subsystems of JWST. For the majority of work remaining, the JWST project is relying on Given the remaining integration and test work ahead—the phase in development where problems are most likely to be found and schedules tend to slip—and risks remaining to be reduced to acceptable levels, coupled with a low level of schedule reserves, we believe that additional delays to the project’s launch readiness date are likely. Since our last report, the JWST project has made considerable progress toward completing its third and fourth of five total integration and test phases for the combined optical telescope element and integrated science instrument module (OTIS) and the spacecraft elements, respectively. Previously, the project’s analysis determined that the expected durations provided by Northrop Grumman were overly optimistic. As a result, the project incorporated uncertainty factors into the analysis, which added 2 to 3 months to the schedule. Northrop Grumman has needed to maintain higher workforce levels due to technical challenges and the work taking longer than expected. Figure 6 illustrates the difference between the workforce levels that Northrop Grumman projected for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and its actual workforce levels during that period.

  "The National 911 Program is in the early stages of establishing a National NG911 Roadmap. As stated above, officials stated it may be appropriate for agencies participating in the roadmap initiative to perform specific tasks after the roadmap is finalized. We have previously examined interagency collaborative mechanisms and identified certain key issues for federal agencies to consider when using these mechanisms to achieve results. Our prior work has found that following leading collaboration practices, such as clarifying roles and responsibilities of agencies engaged in collaboration, can enhance and sustain collaboration among agencies and provide an understanding of who will do what in support of meeting the aims of the collaborative group. As stated above, the RFP specifies that a roadmap developed by and adopted by 911 stakeholders could serve as a blueprint to carry out the roadmap’s tasks. Securing the commitment of agencies to assigned roles could help organize the collaborative group’s joint and individual efforts and thereby better facilitate decision making. As we have previously found, a lack of clarity on the roles and responsibilities of agencies participating in an interagency effort—such as the execution of the roadmap’s tasks—may limit agencies’ abilities to effectively achieve shared objectives.

In addition, we interviewed officials from national associations representing emergency-response- technology companies, wireless and wireline phone carriers, emergency- communications entities, and groups representing deaf and hard-of- hearing consumers to gain their perspectives on federal actions taken and next steps. We assessed the National 911 Program’s strategic- planning activities against leading practices for performance management found in our prior work on strategic planning and goal setting and federal internal control standards.

We assessed the National 911 Program’s planned activities for the national roadmap project against federal internal control standards and selected key practices to enhance interagency collaboration identified in our prior work. In other states, 911 governance structures vary among states. These varying governance structures may pose different challenges. For example, some states have a centralized structure in which a single government agency is responsible for statewide 911 system’s administration and policy. Officials in two states told us that although they faced challenges transitioning to NG911, their states’ centralized 911",
  " reported that CMS and the HHS-OIG had identified a number of areas of concern in Medicaid that have hindered or hindered the success of audits. We recommended that CMS address the barriers that limit state participation in collaborative audits, including their use in managed care delivery systems. CMS concurred with this recommendation and has taken steps to address them for a number of states, but has not yet made such changes accessible to a majority of states. State auditors and federal partners. We have found that state auditors and the HHS-OIG offer additional oversight and information that can help identify program risks. To that end, we routinely coordinate our audit efforts with the state auditors and the HHS-OIG. For example, we have convened and facilitated meetings between CMS and state audit officials to discuss specific areas of concern in Medicaid and future opportunities for collaboration. The state auditors and CMS officials commented on the benefits of such coordination, with the state auditors noting that they can assist CMS’s state program integrity reviews by identifying program risks. State auditors also have conducted program integrity reviews to identify improper payments and deficiencies in the processes used to identify them. We believe that these reviews could provide insights into the appropriateness of managed care spending. The following are recent examples of reviews conducted: In 2017, the Oregon Secretary of State Audits Division found approximately 31,300 questionable payments to Coordinated Care Organizations (which receive capitated monthly payments for beneficiaries, similar to managed care organizations), based on a review of 15 months of data. We believe that these reviews could provide insights into program risks in Medicaid managed care. This potential understatement of the program risks in managed care also may curtail investigations into the appropriateness of managed care spending.

We believe that these reviews could provide insights into program risks in Medicaid managed care. We believe that these reviews could provide insights into program weaknesses that CMS could learn from and potentially address nationally. Coordination also provides an opportunity for state auditors to learn methods for conducting program integrity reviews. The following are recent examples of reviews conducted: The continued growth of Medicaid managed care makes ensuring the accuracy of managed care improper payment estimates increasingly important. In May 2018, we acknowledged that although CMS has increased its focus on and worked with states to improve oversight of Medicaid supplemental care; its efforts—for example, updated regulations and audits of managed care providers—did not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable costs. In May 2016, CMS updated its regulations for managed care programs, including that states arrange an independent audit of the data submitted by MCOs, at least once every 3 years. We found that this requirement has the potential to enhance state’s per capita income in relation to the national average per capita income. States have flexibility in determining how their Medicaid benefits are delivered. For example, states may (1) spent funds states can accrue for each year of a demonstration, and has also reduced the amount of unspent funds that states can carry forward to new demonstrations. For 10 demonstrations it has recently approved, HHS estimated that the new policy has reduced total demonstration spending limits by $109 billion for 2016 through 2018, the federal share of which is $62.9 billion. These limits reduce the effect, but do not specifically address all, of the questionable methods and assumptions that we have identified regarding how HHS sets demonstration spending limits. Evaluation of Medicaid demonstrations. In a January 2018 report, we questioned the usefulness of both state-led and federal evaluations of section 1115 demonstrations, particularly with regard to how these evaluation results may inform policy decisions. State-led evaluations. In February 2016 we reported that CMS did not have written guidance that clarifies this policy. In February 2016, we found examples of hospitals with large uncompensated costs associated with serving the low-income and Medicaid population that received relatively little in supplemental payments, while other hospitals with relatively low uncompensated care costs—but that were able to contribute a large amount of funds for the state’s Medicaid share— received large supplemental payments relative to those costs.

  "Our simulations also provide a baseline from which to view the experiences of individual state and local governments. Finally, assessing the fiscal outlook of the sector as a whole can help mitigate the tendency to extrapolate from the most visible, but potentially not representative, experiences of individual states or localities. Our baseline approach to simulating the fiscal outlook for the state and local government sector is described in appendix I. As part of our simulation approach, we used five variables with values for the simulation period—the period from 2018 through 2092—that are projected outside the model and that do not rely on maintaining historical relationships. Our main indicator of the sector’s fiscal balance is its operating balance net of funds for capital expenditures (henceforth, operating balance), which is a measure of the sector’s ability to cover its current expenditures out of current revenues. Our simulations suggest that state and local governments will need to make policy changes to avoid fiscal imbalances before then and assure that revenues are at least equal to expenditures. Our main indicator of the sector’s fiscal balance is its operating balance net of funds for capital expenditures (henceforth, operating balance), which is a measure of the sector’s ability to cover its current expenditures out of current revenues. The operating balance is defined as total receipts minus (1) capital outlays not financed by medium- and long-term debt issuance, (2) total current expenditures less depreciation, (3) current surplus of state and local government enterprises, and (4) net social insurance fund balance. Alternative indicators of fiscal balance include net saving and net lending or borrowing. Net saving is the difference between current receipts and current expenditures. Net saving is the difference between current receipts and current expenditures. Since current expenditures exclude capital investment but include a depreciation measure, net saving can be thought of as a measure of the extent to which governments are covering their current operations from current receipts. For our baseline simulations, we projected real U.S. GDP to grow at the same rate as Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections for the period from 2018 through 2028 and to grow at the same rate as the OASDI Trustees’ intermediate projections of real U.S. GDP. We concluded that the variables were cointegrated if we rejected the null hypothesis of no relationship at standard significance levels. Current tax receipts. These receipts are tax payments made by persons or businesses to state and local governments. They include income taxes, general sales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes. However, they exclude fixed capital consumption. The former three categories are cash expenditures, while the latter is a noncash charge. Net lending or net borrowing represents the governments’ cash surplus or borrowing requirement. This measure is normally negative because governments borrow to finance their capital investment. This measure is normally negative because governments borrow to finance their capital investment. This measure is normally negative because governments borrow to finance their capital investment (and sometimes to finance current operations as well). The following equations describe how we simulated state and local government receipts and expenditures. These receipts are grouped in five main categories. Current expenditures. These receipts include interest, dividends, and rental income, Similarly, future changes in the real amount of state and local government expenditures will be a function of past changes in real wages and salaries. As indicated in table 3, we used a weighted average of past values of the state and local government employment cost index to simulate the employment cost index for state and local government retirees. Our method for simulating the sectors’ short-term debt outstanding leverages the fact that for any entity, there is a direct relationship between budget outcomes and changes in financial position. Specifically, if expenditures exceed receipts, the gap needs to be financed by some combination of changes in financial assets and changes in financial position. In addition, under TCJA, the amount of the federal itemized deductions allowed for all state and local income, sales, and property taxes (commonly referred to as the state and local tax (SALT) deduction) is now capped at $10,000 for tax years 2018 to 2025. The magnitude or net effect of these changes is uncertain in that states are still working to understand the impact of the tax laws on their revenues and that the difference between revenues and expenditures would become increasingly negative during the next several decades. The relationship between budget outcomes and the sector’s financial position is shown in the following accounting identity: total receipts – total expenditures = change in financial assets less the change in financial liabilities divided by the number of retirees. The sector’s net financial investment (the change in financial assets minus the change in financial liabilities) must equal the budget surplus. The relationship between budget outcomes and the sector’s financial position is shown in the following accounting identity: total receipts – total expenditures = change in financial assets – change in financial liabilities. The sector’s financial liabilities include short-, medium-, and long-term debt; trade payables; and loans from the sector. The sector’s liabilities include short-, medium-, and long-term debt;",
  "DOD guidance states that the Air Force is attempting to address the competing demands for limited adversary air to grow as the Air Force stands up more F-35 squadrons. The Air Force recognizes and is attempting to mitigate adversary air shortfalls. For example, the Air Force has hired contractors to address Air Force adversary air shortfalls at exercises, as we previously reported. The Air Force is specifically responsible for gaining and maintaining air superiority. The Air Force Strategic Master Plan states that the Air Force must focus clearly on the capabilities that will allow freedom of maneuver and decisive action in highly contested spaces, including high-end air capabilities. Fifth generation fighter capabilities and ready and trained Airmen who are properly equipped for their missions are central components of the Air Force’s ability to provide air superiority in contested environments. The F-22 is the Air Force’s fifth generation, air superiority fighter that incorporates a stealthy and highly maneuverable airframe, advanced integrated avionics, and engines capable of sustained supersonic flight. Fourth generation fighters do not have to contend with this maintenance issue. The F-22’s LO coating is actually a series of coatings that require diligent and time-consuming application and curing.

The Air Force has begun to address these maintenance issues by using a more durable coating and standing up additional repair facilities. The Air Force has begun to address these maintenance issues by using a more durable coating and standing up additional repair facilities. Second, the F-22 faces a number of supply challenges that have contributed to reduced and unpredictable aircraft availability. Officials from all four operational locations expressed concerns over low supply levels and difficulties with obtaining needed parts. The F-22 fleet’s small size and resulting low demand for parts contributes to this problem. Obtaining missing parts can be a time-consuming and costly process because some original manufacturers no longer make the parts or are completely out of business, according to Air Force officials. When this is the case, the Air Force may need to find the original aircraft and parts design plans, and obtain a new contractor to produce a small number of parts. Officials from all four operational locations expressed concerns over low supply levels and difficulties with obtaining needed parts. The F-22 fleet’ F-22 squadrons DOD’s Joint Publication 3-0, Joint Operations, states that risk management is the process to identify, assess, and control hazards arising from operational factors and make decisions that balance risk and cost with mission benefits. It assists organizations and individuals in making informed decisions to reduce or offset risk, thereby increasing operational effectiveness and the probability of mission success. The second option, called cannibalization, is an inefficient way to conduct maintenance because it doubles the work. A good part needs to be removed from one aircraft and put into another. Once the replacement part arrives, it needs to be installed on the cannibalized aircraft. Once the replacement part arrives, it needs to be installed on the cannibalized aircraft. Once the replacement part arrives, it needs to be installed on the cannibalized aircraft. There is also a chance that the cannibalized part could get damaged in the process or just not work. Further, cannibalization could result in additional LO repairs on the donor aircraft. An Air Force report summarizing fiscal year 2016 maintenance issues reported that F-22 pilot air superiority skills degrade while on deployment because they are conducting CAS missions and not able to train for their air superiority missions, according to Air Force officials. The F-22’s small fleet size also exacerbates supply challenges it is facing with its engines, potentially falling below minimum spare part requirements for multiple calendar years. Further, the F-22’s role has also evolved since 2010. For example, F-22s have begun participating in combat operations in Iraq and Syria. Additionally, potential adversaries are increasingly able to challenge U.S. air superiority, according to Air Force officials. In 2016, the Air Force examined its future air superiority capability needs in its Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan, but that review did not include an assessment of organizational structure. Such an assessment could consider a number of alternatives, such an assessment could",
  "nonrecurring costs will likely lead to a loss of sale. DOD guidance states these waiver requests should include information on competing items and their cost, if available; however, the guidance does not specify the type of information or level of detail that should be provided. DSCA officials stated that they interpret this guidance to mean this information is optional and therefore not required. According to DOD officials, a foreign government’s budget constraints could limit its ability to pay nonrecurring costs. Of the 18 loss of sale waiver requests that we reviewed, none included any additional information on competing offers or spending limits, beyond the basic loss of sale statement. Even if DOD received this type of information from the foreign government, DSCA officials told us that corroborating this information would be difficult. Therefore, DOD officials stated that they do not assess the likelihood of loss of sale beyond the minimum criteria. Although this assessment requires no additional analysis, loss of sale waiver requests are subject to the same review process, but with OUSD Policy as another required layer of review, bringing the possible total up to 12 offices. DSCA and OUSD Policy officials were unsure of the origin of the requirement for OUSD Policy to weigh in on waiver requests that cite loss of sale.

The first phase of the FMS process generally involves a foreign government submitting a request, usually to State or DOD, to express interest in purchasing defense articles or services. Depending on the size and complexity of the items being purchased and the foreign government’s available budget, the process to finalize the terms of a sale can take from a few days to years. In response to concerns that the FMS process is slow and burdensome, Congress has increased oversight of the program and recently passed legislation intended to improve the timeliness of the FMS process. For example, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Congress required DOD to revise its acquisition regulations to place new requirements on FMS contracting and to establish a pilot program to seek ways to accelerate contracting and pricing processes for FMS. DSCA officials were uncertain of a new deployment date as system requirements are currently being re-validated and expected to continue through 2020. Our review found that DOD considers a variety of factors when reviewing nonrecurring cost waiver requests, but, ultimately, the department wants to ensure that sales are not jeopardized. Individually and collectively, these sales complement various foreign policy, national security, and economic objectives. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, DOD approved 99 percent of the 813 nonrecurring cost waiver requests for major defense equipment sold through the FMS program. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, DOD approved 99 percent of the 813 nonrecurring cost waiver requests for major defense equipment sold through the FMS program. One waiver request from a foreign government that would have been eligible to use the equipment standardization justification but cited the loss of sale justification in its waiver request. The only waiver requests from a foreign government that would have been eligible to use the equipment standardization justification but cited the loss of sale justification in its waiver request. To select the remaining 19 waivers, we set a threshold for waivers approved where the value of the nonrecurring cost was over $20 million to capture high-value waivers, as these waivers represented 80 percent of the total value of approved waivers within our time frame for our sample selection. Next, we selected at least 2 waiver requests from each fiscal year for the 6-year period included in our review and ensured a mix of waivers requested by various foreign governments, including those that had the highest value of waivers approved. Overall, we found that the documentation for the selected waiver requests generally matched the data DSCA provided. We interviewed DSCA officials responsible for the data to identify the quality controls in place to ensure the data are accurate and reliable. In total, these approved nonrecurring cost waivers amounted to nearly $16 billion. In total, these approved nonrecurring cost waivers amounted to nearly $16 billion",
  "RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers. RRB administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers and their families under the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, as amended (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act of 1938, as amended (RUIA). Individuals who work for railroads engaged in interstate commerce, for railroad associations, and for railroad labor organizations are among those covered by RRB’s benefits system instead of Social Security or the federal-state unemployment insurance system. During fiscal year 2016, RRB generally reviews the beneficiary’s continuing eligibility for disability benefits at intervals from 6 months to 18 months. For MIP cases, RRB mails a questionnaire at least once every 3 years that asks a beneficiary to update medical and earnings information. If the self-reported information indicates medical improvement or a return to work, RRB may conduct a CDR. For MINE cases, RRB’s regulations state that it will not routinely review the beneficiary’s continuing eligibility. RRB also collects taxes to cover additional benefits. A financial interchange between the two systems may also affect how and when RRB classifies a beneficiary as MINE, or whether it should schedule (or “diary”) a CDR. RRB may conduct a CDR. For MINE cases, RRB’s regulations state that it will not routinely review the beneficiary’s continuing eligibility. RRB also collects taxes to cover additional benefits. A financial interchange between the two systems may also affect how and when RRB classifies a beneficiary as MINE, or whether it should schedule (or “diary”) a CDR. RRB maintains a list of scheduled CDRs. RRB’s regulations state that it will not routinely review the beneficiary’s continuing eligibility. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7215 or curdae@gao.gov. RRB agreed with all three of the recommendations and noted that it has already taken initial steps to implement them. A financial interchange between the two systems may also affect how and when RRB classifies a beneficiary as MINE, or whether it should schedule (or “diary”) a CDR. RRB maintains a list of scheduled CDRs, as well as the payroll taxes that would have been collected if the railroad workers were covered by Social Security instead of their own system. According to RRB data, the railroad retirement, survivor, and disability system is projected to remain solvent over at least the next 25 years. Under the RRA, RRB provides two distinct disability benefits for railroad workers—total and permanent (T&P) disability and occupational disability. In addition to medical reviews, RRB conducts earnings CDRs for beneficiaries detected with earnings that exceed disability program limits. Most earnings CDRs are triggered by unreported earnings detected through RRB’s policing operation. Policing for earnings involves an annual data match by SSA in According to the data provided by RRB, about 90 percent of individuals who received a disability payment in fiscal year 2016 found the earned income in question ranged from 2011 through 2013. RRB officials acknowledged that the data it currently uses for its policing effort cause delays in identifying earnings. When overpayments are not identified in a timely manner, RRB’s ability to detect when a beneficiary is not eligible for benefits is hindered, thereby increasing the potential for lost federal dollars. More specifically, the manual instructs disability examiners to classify beneficiaries over age 54½ as “medical improvement not expected” because of the remote likelihood that they will be able to engage in medium or heavy work. Scheduled medical CDRs resulted in few terminations and identified few overpayments. Data provided by RRB indicate that of the 43 medical CDRs completed during fiscal years 2014-2016, 3 ineligible beneficiaries were identified and 1 overpayment of $28,000 was identified and calculated. RRB determined that 40 of the 43 beneficiaries (93 percent) continued to meet the appropriate disability criteria for occupational or T&P disability, as applicable, and qualify for benefits. However, according to a RRB official, IRS earnings data are currently the only source to which RRB has access for earnings policing that includes all of its disability beneficiaries. RRB has considered conducting earnings policing using the Department of Health and Human Services’ quarterly earnings data from the National Directory of New Hires, which includes the most recent eight quarters of wages reported from all states. In fiscal years 2017-2019, RRB determined that 40 of the 43 beneficiaries (93 percent) continued to meet the appropriate disability criteria for occupational or T&P disability, as applicable, and qualify for benefits. In fiscal years 2014-2016, RRB received approximately $28, as applicable",
  "We will continue to monitor these actions. We will continue to monitor these actions. We will continue to monitor these actions. We will continue to monitor these actions. We will continue to monitor these actions. Use more realistic asset performance data. In our May 2016 report on Coast Guard strategic planning, we found that the Coast Guard did not provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets, by mission. We reported that the Coast Guard’s strategic allocations of assets were based on unrealistic assumptions about the performance capacity of its assets and did not reflect asset condition and unscheduled maintenance. This was due, in part, to the Coast Guard not including information from its field units on the actual performance of its assets. For example, agency officials noted that one of its classes of cutters was 50 years old and these cutters were hampered by mechanical failures requiring emergency dry dock repairs, which resulted in reduced availability to carry out their missions during the year. In another example, a field unit stated that based on historical use, it planned for 575 hours per vessel for one type of cutter instead of the 825 hours performance capacity. Because actual asset use has consistently fallen below asset performance capacities, there is not a direct alignment between the Coast Guard’s strategic operational goals and its prospects for achieving those goals. As a result, the headquarters’ strategic intent, which is based on asset capacity rather than actual performance, did not provide the field with strategic, realistic goals for allocating assets by mission. Agencies should use quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and timely to achieve objectives and address related risks. Because actual asset use has consistently fallen below asset performance capacities, there is not a direct alignment between the Coast Guard’s strategic operational goals and its prospects for achieving those goals. As a result, the headquarters’ strategic intent, which is based on asset capacity rather than actual performance, did not provide the field with strategic, realistic goals for allocating assets by mission. Agencies should use quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and timely to achieve objectives and address related risks. For each of its 11 missions, the Coast Guard has developed goals and targets to assess and communicate agency performance. The Coast Guard’s performance assessment process also includes identifying performance gaps and implementing corrective actions to address unmet performance goals. As part of its process, the Coast Guard is to establish targets for the current and subsequent 2 fiscal years, according to Coast Guard officials. Each target is set by the Coast Guard, but according to the Coast Guard’s Annual Performance Report (APR), some are derived from external factors. We recommended that the Coast Guard incorporate field unit input, such as information on assets’ actual performance, to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation, and in February 2018 informed us that it plans to address this recommendation through changes to two process documents that are under revision, with an expected completion date in March 2018. Improve performance goal data. In our October 2017 review of Coast Guard performance goals, the Coast Guard For example, one of the Coast Guard’s missions—defense readiness—has no goals that are publicly reported or shared with Congress, even though measures related to defense readiness are included in the Coast Guard’s APR. Coast Guard officials stated that they could see the benefit of publicly releasing their APR; however, DHS’s decision to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly has so far deterred the Coast Guard from pursuing the public release of its APR. DHS officials told us that the department is concerned about conflicting information that a component’s APR might present because it is vetted and produced separately from the DHS APR. However, the lack of transparency regarding performance data shared publicly and with Congress can result in an incomplete picture of mission performance and can limit effective oversight of Coast Guard operations. As a result, the public and Congress may be unable to determine the extent to which the Coast Guard is meeting its missions. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation and in February 2018, the Coast Guard informed us that it had completed its 2017 APR and are determining an appropriate approach for making it publicly available. Improve performance goal data. In our previously issued work on the Coast Guard’s annual 5-year capital investment plan (CIP), we found that the CIP does not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs that are included as part of the annual budget cycle. We recommended that future Coast Guard APRs be available on the Coast Guard’s public website. We recommended that future Coast Guard APRs be available on the Coast Guard’s public website. As a result, the Coast Guard may be unable to determine the public and Congress may be unable to determine the extent to which the Coast Guard is meeting its missions. We recommended that future Coast Guard APRs be available on the Coast Guard’s public website.",
  "es we interviewed said that invoices do not have enough information about the contractor and the work performed. Additionally, 4 of these licensees stated that they cannot determine whether the amounts charged were accurate or reasonable without more information. Challenges related to verifying charges may be addressed by some of NRC’s recent changes to its billing process, which include updating invoices. NRC is updating its invoices to include (1) standardized activity codes that have titles describing the specific work activity completed, (2) the names of the NRC staff charging time to the licensee, and (3) the name of the contractor that performed the work for which the licensee is being billed. NRC staff expected to issue the updated invoices to licensees in January 2018, after we completed our audit work. Therefore, we could not assess licensees’ satisfaction with the updated invoices. According to a planning document for some of NRC’s recent changes, the agency intends to solicit feedback from licensees in fiscal year 2018 on whether the agency’s billing process can be improved. NRC staff told us that, without the sorting and filtering capabilities of an electronic spreadsheet, this licensee is not able to verify the accuracy of charges for specific components of the work that NRC is doing. NRC’s financial management system is responsible for the financial management system. According to a planning document for some of NRC’s recent changes, the agency intends to solicit feedback from licensees in fiscal year 2018 on whether the agency’s billing process can be improved. NRC staff told us that, without the sorting and filtering capabilities of an electronic spreadsheet, this licensee is not able to verify the accuracy of charges for specific components of the work that NRC is doing. Another licensee told us that it is difficult to track costs of projects to completion without an electronic spreadsheet of charges. NRC now provides biweekly reports in an electronic spreadsheet format, which may help address the challenges these licensees cited. However, as discussed above, NRC does not provide these biweekly reports unless they are requested, and some licensees do not know that they are available. Licensees also cited challenges with the timeliness of invoices, request that NRC review the fees assessed, or dispute the fees. These billing disputes generally start informally with the licensee contacting NRC. According to NRC staff, most disputes are handled informally and generally entail explanations of the agency’s billing or licensing policies. If NRC staff are unable to resolve a licensee’s concern informally, the licensee can write a letter to the Chief Financial Officer, which begins a formal dispute process. According to NRC staff, to address a licensee’s concerns with the charges, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer reviews the charges on the invoice and may involve the relevant regional or program offices to determine whether the charges are valid for the work performed. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer reviews the charges on the invoice and may involve the relevant regional or program offices to determine whether the charges are valid for the work performed. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer reviews the charges on the invoice and may involve the relevant regional or program offices to determine whether the charges are valid for the work performed. To calculate the cost of work performed by NRC staff, According to the OIG, these conditions increased risk for staff to inadvertently select the wrong activity codes when recording their time; in such cases, the wrong licensee could be billed for the work. According to an internal NRC review, these errors accounted for approximately two-thirds of the billing errors identified during the quarterly validation process. At the beginning of fiscal year 2016, NRC started billing this overhead time as a separate fee on invoices that is calculated as 6 percent of all NRC billable hours on an invoice, which eliminated the billing errors related to overhead. However, NRC analyzed this billing method again in fiscal year 2017 and determined that eliminating the percentage charge and having staff charge their billable overhead time to billable activity codes would be more equitable. NRC intends to implement a new process for charging billable overhead time at the start of fiscal year 2019. According to NRC staff, the agency has made administrative changes to address the factors that contributed to project managers and resident inspectors incorrectly charging overhead time in the past. Licensees we interviewed identified challenges with the amount of information available about NRC’s billable work, which, according to NRC’s recent changes have made more information available, but some licensees are not aware of the information.

  " and defer requirements to later years. However, given the F-35’s global sustainment strategy of providing support across the military services and the international partners through shared pools of funding, a single customer that cannot fully fund requirements may affect the ability of DOD and the contractor to provide adequate sustainment support across the global F-35 fleet. F-35 actual sustainment costs that are being charged by the program office to the military services, as well as the capabilities associated with those costs, are not fully transparent to the services. In addition to estimating projected costs for F-35 sustainment over the aircraft’s life cycle as described above, the program office also calculates the actual F-35 sustainment costs that will be charged to the military services, as well as the capabilities associated with those costs, are not fully transparent to the services. In addition to estimating projected costs for F-35 sustainment over the aircraft’s life cycle as described above, the program office also calculates the actual F-35 sustainment costs that will be charged to the military services, as well as the capabilities associated with those costs, are not fully transparent to the services. In addition to estimating projected costs for F-35 sustainment over the aircraft’s life cycle as described above, the program office also calculates the actual F- 35 sustainment costs that will be charged to the military services on an annual basis. To determine these actual sustainment costs, the military services first submit their F-35 sustainment capability requirements to the program office for approval. The program office approves requirements as a basis for its annual life-cycle operating and support cost estimate, which is used to provide each of the military services with an estimate for their respective portion of F-35 sustainment costs to support the services’ budget planning process. The program office then negotiates with the prime contractor the level of support the contractor will provide to meet service sustainment requirements. In 2019, DOD plans to begin full-rate production of the F-35. In 2012, DOD’s Department of Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed an increased use of performance- based logistics agreements, stating that such agreements can yield significant cost and performance benefits if effectively implemented. DOD has developed a series of performance objectives to provide insight into the level of sustainment support that the prime contractor is providing to the military services. For example, the program office has established a Cost War Room to identify and implement cost- reduction initiatives with the goal of reducing the program office’s 2012 operating and support cost estimate by 30 percent by 2022. According to program office’s F-35 operational requirements, which, according to the program office’s F-35 operational requirements, are not fully transparent to the military services. In addition, the program office has developed a series of performance objectives to provide insight into the level of sustainment support that the prime contractor is providing to the military services. In addition, the program office has established a Cost War Room to identify and implement cost- reduction initiatives with the goal of reducing the program office’s 2012 operating and support cost estimate by 30 percent by 2022. According to program documentation, such efforts are projected to result in $1.7 billion in operating and support costs for F-35 operating and support, which, according to the program office’s fiscal year 2016 cost estimate, is approximately $1.7 billion. In addition, the Air Force identified a minimum performance target for F-35s in April 2017, even though the performance of its aircraft fell well below desired Marine Corps performance levels for F-35 sustainment more affordable. Program officials said that they are currently working with the prime contractor to develop a list of technical data requirements. There are many different components of the F-35 aircraft that DOD plans to repair at the six military depots within the United States, as documented in an F-35 Depot Implementation Plan. Repair capabilities at the military depots were originally planned to be completed by 2016, but program officials told us that some capabilities have now been delayed until 2022. Program officials in part attributed these delays to the military services not providing enough funding for depot requirements; however, service officials told us that the program office deals with such risks on a case-by-case basis, and that if a data right needed by the program office to implement the sustainment strategy cannot be obtained, then plans will have to be adjusted accordingly. Without reexamining the metrics to ensure that they are objectively measurable, reflective of processes that the contractor can control, and able to motivate desired behaviors, DOD may not be well positioned to accurately assess contractor performance or achieve optimal outcomes across future performance-based sustainment contracts that will likely cost tens of billions of dollars. DOD does not yet have full information on F-35 sustainment costs or technical characteristics such as reliability and maintainability, and this could pose risks to its ability to effectively negotiate 5-year, fixed-price performance-based contracts with the prime contractor by 2020. We found the following: The following",
  " fiscal year. In this regard, funds for Indian health services that IHS transfers to tribes and tribal organizations during the 1-year period of availability are deemed to be obligated at the time of the award and thereafter remain available to the tribes to operate their own health care programs without fiscal year limitation. Thus, to the extent sufficient funding remained available from federal or other sources during a lapse in appropriations, a tribe could continue to operate its own health care programs during a shutdown. To operate IHS’s health care system on an emergency basis during a funding gap, IHS would need to determine what programs and activities qualified for an emergency exception under the law. Contingency planning for government shutdowns. Federal agencies must determine what activities and programs they are permitted or required to continue prior to a potential shutdown. This includes designating certain employees as “excepted” employees who would be expected to continue to work during the shutdown and who would be paid upon the enactment of an appropriation. Employees who are not “excepted” would be subject to furlough. Citing funding uncertainty associated with continued use of CRs, AI/AN advocacy groups such as the National Indian Health Board have requested that Congress grant IHS advance appropriation authority; legislation to provide IHS advance appropriation authority has been introduced more than once. The most recent such legislation, H.R. 235, introduced in January 2017 (not enacted), would have provided IHS with permanent leadership—including a Director of IHS—which is necessary for the agency to demonstrate its commitment to improvement. Additionally, a tribal representative said the uncertainty of the availability of funds due to a CR resulted in a downgrading of the tribe’s credit rating, and hence higher interest rates, as it was planning a clinic expansion. During a government shutdown, some tribes must redistribute funds from other budget categories to replace health care funding from IHS in order to continue providing health care services. The most recent such legislation, H.R. 235, introduced in January 2017 (not enacted), would have provided IHS with 2-year fiscal budget authority, which are led by area directors; 10 of these 12 IHS areas have federally operated IHS facilities. IHS’s headquarters office is responsible for setting health care policy, helping to ensure the delivery of quality comprehensive health services, and advocating for the health needs and concerns of AI/AN people. The IHS area offices are responsible for distributing funds to the facilities in their areas, monitoring their operation, and providing guidance and technical assistance. IHS’s estimated budget authority for fiscal year 2018 is over $5.6 billion, an increase of almost $580 million from its enacted budget authority of just over $5 billion in fiscal year 2017. HHS, on behalf of IHS, has not requested that IHS be granted advance appropriation authority during its annual budget submissions to Congress. VA, through the VHA, provides approximately 54 percent of its total budget authority to tribes and tribal organizations. For example, in 2017, the agency transferred approximately 54 percent of its total budget authority to tribes and tribal organizations to operate part or all of their For example, policy changes can include adding an additional presumptive condition—such as health conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure—resulting in a new health benefit, or a costly new drug treatment, as in the case of the addition to the drug formulary of a new Hepatitis C drug treatment. Despite having advance appropriation authority, VA has faced challenges in budget formulation, in addition to the general management and oversight challenges we cited in adding VA to our High-Risk List in 2015. IHS officials said in our 2017 update to the High-Risk List that VA faces challenges regarding the reliability, transparency, and consistency of its budget estimates for medical services, as well as weaknesses in tracking obligations for medical services and estimating budgetary needs for future years. These challenges were evident in June 2015, when VA requested authority from Congress to move funds from another appropriation account because agency officials projected a fiscal year 2015 funding gap of about $3 billion in its medical services appropriation account. Tribes attempt to mitigate the challenge of not knowing their final annual payment from IHS under recurrent CRs by keeping extra funds in",
  "In addition, although OMB has issued guidance aimed at addressing the three factors that were identified by at least half of the CIOs as major challenges, the guidance does not fully address those challenges. Further, regarding the financial resources challenge, OMB recently required agencies to provide data on CIO authority over IT spending; however, its guidance does not provide a complete definition of the authority. We believe that in the absence of such guidance, agencies have created varying definitions of CIO authority. As of May 2018, 80 of these 160 recommendations remained unimplemented. Further, we recently reported in May 2018 that the 24 agencies participating in OMB’s Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) had communicated mixed progress toward achieving OMB’s goals for closing data centers by September 2018.

The Department of Defense’s Expeditionary Combat Support System was canceled in December 2012 after spending more than a billion dollars and failing to deploy within 5 years of initially obligating funds. However, 4 agencies reported that they do not have plans to meet all of their assigned goals and 2 agencies are working with OMB to establish revised targets. OMB’s FITARA implementation guidance expanded upon this aspect of the legislation in a number of ways. Specifically, according to the guidance: CIOs may review and approve IT acquisition strategies and plans, rather than individual IT contracts; CIOs can designate other agency officials to act as their representatives, but the CIOs must retain accountability; CAOs are responsible for ensuring that all IT contract actions are consistent with CIO-approved acquisition strategies and plans; and CAOs are responsible for ensuring that all IT contract actions are consistent with CIO-approved acquisition strategies and plans; and CAOs are to indicate to the CIOs when planned acquisition strategies and acquisition plans include IT. OMB’s FITARA implementation guidance expanded upon this aspect of the legislation in a number of ways. In January 2018, we reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT Among other things, we recommended that the agencies regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software licenses and analyze the inventory to identify opportunities to reduce costs and better inform investment decision making. Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no comments. As of May 2018, 78 of the 135 recommendations had not been implemented. As of May 2018, 78 of the 135 recommendations had not been implemented. Table 2 reflects the extent to which the 24 agencies implemented the recommendations in these two areas. Since information security was added to the high-risk list in 1997, we have consistently identified shortcomings in the federal government’s approach to cybersecurity. We have previously testified that, even though agencies have acted to improve the protections over federal and critical infrastructure information and information systems, the federal government needs to take the following actions to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity: Effectively implement risk-based entity-wide information security programs consistently over time. Among other things, agencies need to (1) implement sustainable processes for securely configuring operating systems, applications, workstations, servers, and network devices; (2) patch vulnerable systems and replace unsupported software; (3) develop comprehensive security test and evaluation procedures and conduct examinations on a regular and recurring basis; and (4) strengthen oversight of contractors providing IT services. In March 2018, OMB issued its annual FISMA report to Congress, which showed the combined results to the President on policies and plans aimed at improving government operations and services, improve the quality of life for Americans, and spur job creation. In May 2017, the Administration also established the American Technology Council, which has a goal of helping to transform and modernize federal agency IT and how the federal government uses and delivers digital services.

Further, the preliminary cost estimates developed by NNSA for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge technology options were limited in scope. The preliminary cost estimates developed by NNSA for the large centrifuge and small centrifuge technology options were limited in scope—sized for a capacity to enrich uranium only for tritium production—and do not reflect the full costs of building a uranium enrichment facility that could eventually meet a range of enriched uranium mission needs. Prior to the use of TVA’s reactor, the United States used other government-owned reactors to produce tritium (see fig. 1). In 1999, TVA signed an interagency agreement with DOE to produce tritium at its Watts Bar and Sequoyah commercial nuclear reactors. Due to degradation of the equipment, the expected rate of equipment failure, a lack of replacement parts, the dispersion of trained and qualified personnel, and ongoing decontamination and demolition activities, a major effort would be required to support tritium production for a number of years.

NNSA officials also stated that there will be challenges in establishing a U.S. manufacturing base of suppliers for the small The following is a summary of our assessments. Comprehensive. Best practices state that—to be considered comprehensive—a cost estimate should include both government and contractor costs of the project over its full life cycle, from “cradle to grave.” This includes costs from the inception of the project through design, development, deployment, and operation and maintenance, to retirement of the project. According to NNSA and State Department officials, longstanding U.S. policy will likely preclude the use of these options. The mission need statement indicates a preference for using enriched uranium to continue the tritium production mission, as it only identifies options to obtain additional enriched uranium. The mission need statement indicates a preference for using enriched uranium to continue the tritium production mission, as it only identifies options to obtain additional enriched uranium. This approach would exclude consideration of certain technology options, such as one that may have the potential to produce tritium without the need for enriched uranium. According to a senior DOE official, though DOE has discontinued the majority of its funding, the department has taken two actions to preserve the large centrifuge technology—preserving the intellectual property for this technology and hiring some former Centrus employees—to ensure that the technology can be deployed if it is selected in the analysis of alternatives. Further, under NNSA’s timeline for a domestic uranium enrichment capability, it could take until 2027 to begin construction of a uranium enrichment plant. We found that the cost estimate to build a large centrifuge facility partially met the comprehensive characteristic because it included a high-level description of the work to be performed, and presented a brief summary description of the schedule, number of machines, and activities. However, the estimate was not a life cycle cost estimate because it excluded certain costs, and",
  "Part 1: Safety and effectiveness determination. The agency may not have access to this level of detail, but some of them said the agency should also consider the potential benefit of preventing skin cancer if new ingredients—which could offer better protection against UVA rays—become available for the U.S. market. We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human Services for review and comment. The department provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, appropriate congressional committees, as well as other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7114 or crossem@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. To examine the steps the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken to review time and extent (TEA) applications for non-sunscreen active ingredients, we reviewed the Sunscreen Innovation Act (SIA), applicable FDA regulations and guidance, and other relevant documentation associated with the non-sunscreen TEAs. According to sponsor representatives we spoke with, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA recommend that consumers use broad spectrum sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or more as directed and in conjunction with other sun- protective measures, such as seeking shade and wearing protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses. Current recommendations also state that sunscreen should be reapplied every 2 hours and after swimming, sweating, and toweling off. When used incorrectly, sunscreen may provide a false sense of protection, which can ultimately lead to increased UV exposure. Because sunscreens are intended to help prevent sunburn and, in some cases, decrease the risks of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun, these products are considered drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Sunscreens are regulated as OTC (i.e., nonprescription) drugs, which are drugs considered to be safe for use by consumers without the intervention of a health care professional, such as a physician. Broad Spectrum Sunscreen and Sun Protection Factor (SPF) There are two types of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from which one needs protection— UVA and UVB. UVA radiation penetrates the skin more deeply and can cause skin cancer and other skin damage. UVA radiation penetrates the skin more deeply and can cause skin cancer and other skin damage. UVA radiation penetrates the skin more deeply and can result in skin cancer and other skin damage. UVA radiation penetrates the skin more deeply and can result in skin damage. UVA radiation penetrates the skin more deeply and can result in skin damage. UVA radiation penetrates the skin more deeply and can result in skin damage. Broad spectrum sunscreens provide protection against both UVA and UV Though the OTC monograph process began over 40 years ago, FDA officials said that the agency has still not been able to complete many monographs, or make timely changes based on emerging safety issues and evolving science, because of the burdensome regulatory process and inadequate resources. FDA officials estimate that as of October 2017 approximately one third of the monographs are not yet final, and several hundred active ingredients, including those used in sunscreen products, do not have a final GRASE determination. Some stakeholders and sponsor representatives said that one effect associated with SIA was that FDA took action on the sunscreen applications that had been pending for many years. Without the act, some of them questioned whether FDA would have reviewed the sunscreen applications or provided feedback to the sponsors. Though the agency has made an initial GRASE determination, the timing of FDA’s final GRASE determination for each of the eight sunscreen active ingredients will be determined, in part, by when each ingredient’s sponsor provides FDA with the additional safety and effectiveness data. The sponsor for this application did not request to select a review framework from the agency and so the application is subject to the regulations that FDA",
  "-lowering modification, and, according to FHA officials, some modifications could increase monthly payments for borrowers with a large number of missed payments. Likewise, borrowers could lose access to benefits such as reevaluation for the suite of FHA loss mitigation options. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications. FHA officials said that servicers should be able to determine the extent of loan modifications and the extent of loan modifications offered by purchasers. FHA may not be required to sell loan assets if a serious conflict exists between selling loans and policy goals. FHA officials told us that it also has absolute discretion to exclude one or more loans from the sale. According to FHA officials told us that FHA has two different provisions in place to correct when a loan should not have been sold. While we considered classifying loans reported as resold as performing, our review of status sequences for loans with at least one resold status showed that purchasers reported a range of nonperforming outcomes before and after the resold status. Additionally, about 22 percent of the modifications offered to borrowers whose loans were sold in the 2015 sale and later included a deferment. These rates generally exceeded the foreclosure and short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure estimates for similar, unsold loans (34 and about 9 percent, respectively). Purchasers told us that the outcome they pursue for a loan depends in part on the borrower’s preference. If the highest bid was at least $5,054,000, the MMI Fund may not be negatively affected by the sale. The piecewise model estimated that the best option is to try to modify the loan and achieve reperformance status. These rates generally exceeded the foreclosure and short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure estimates for similar, unsold loans. This generally results in a greater loss to the MMI Fund. In the case of a DASP sale, FHA pays a claim to the servicer in the amount of the unpaid mortgage balance and other expenses. In addition, for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure, our calculated reserve price was 25 percent or more below the winning bid. When FHA described its process for evaluating program changes, FHA also described the use and reliability of these data sets in the sections that follow this table. We attempted to minimize differences between the sold and unsold loans by matching loans across several variables that could affect the likelihood of foreclosure or foreclosure. In the case of a DASP sale, FHA avoids interest and servicing costs during the foreclosure period as well as REO-related expenses, but incurs the cost of the difference between the unpaid balance and other expenses. FHA also experienced another period when no sales were conducted between 2005 and 2009. Federal internal control standards require that management implement control activities through policies. This includes documenting in policies the internal control responsibilities of the organization and periodically reviewing policies, procedures, When HUD extended the prohibition against foreclosure from 6 months to 12 months in 2015, for instance, a HUD press release stated that such changes “not only strengthen the program but help to ensure it continues to serve its intended purposes of supporting the MMI Fund and offering borrowers a second chance at avoiding foreclosure.” And when HUD changed DASP in 2016 to prohibit purchasers from abandoning low- value loans prior to being modified to their monthly payments after being modified. We did not independently verify the data in the FHFA reports, but we interviewed the FHFA staff that generated the report about the reliability of the data. Some limitations stem from the differences between FHA’s and the enterprises’ pools and the underlying loans. FHA has additional regulatory requirements, which may also account for higher reperforming rates for sold loans in the 2016 sales. We limited our review of participants and characteristics to the loans included in our comparison analysis of outcomes to provide descriptive context for this analysis. To assess the reliability of the data sources above, we reviewed all loans sold in DASP sales that occurred between 2013 and 2016, with some exceptions, in line with the scope of our comparison analysis of outcomes. We selected this scope because it represented the period for which FHA was generally able to provide consistent postsale quarterly reports. We found that less than 0.1 percent of the sold loans in our scope were not reported as delinquent by servicers and determined that, due to their small percentage, excluding these loans would not bias our results. In addition, FHA may not collect the data it needs to evaluate whether modifications offered by purchasers remain sustainable. Nonetheless, FHA received similar numbers of bids and bid amounts relative to the estimated property values as the enterprises. However, the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of the",
  "“shapefiles”—a geospatial depiction of the coverage area, which FCC refers to as “polygons”—to identify the speeds, technologies, and availability providers reported for federally recognized tribal lands. To understand the purpose of the Form 477 data collection process and FCC’s strategic goals, we reviewed relevant statutes, and FCC documents, including FCC’s Strategic Plan 2018––2022, the National Broadband Plan, and FCC’s broadband deployment and progress reports. Given the importance placed on broadband access in these documents, we reviewed FCC’s data and 2010 U.S. Census data, and for FCC’s data we conducted electronic testing and analysis of the data, reviewed FCC guidance and documentation, and interviewed FCC officials. Based on the results of our analysis, we determined the data to be reliable for our purposes, which were: (1) to inform our selection of tribal governments and providers for interviews and visits, as described below, and (2) to develop maps depicting fixed and mobile broadband availability for the nine tribal lands. Some representatives of tribal governments or organizations we spoke with also told us that providers may have denied service because their equipment was at capacity and could not accommodate new users (see fig. 8). For example, on three of the tribal lands we visited, we observed fiber optic cable located close to government and residential structures that did not have broadband access, as described below, and (2) to develop maps depicting fixed and mobile broadband availability for the nine tribal lands we selected for visits. FCC also noted that it is starting work to address a statutorily-required evaluation of broadband coverage on certain tribal lands. We also reviewed documentation for other FCC data collection programs, including the Measuring Broadband America program and the Urban Rate Survey, to determine the extent to which FCC collected data on factors affecting broadband access outside of the Form 477 process. Broadband service may be “fixed”—that is, providing service to a single location, such as a customer’s home—or “mobile,” that is, providing service wherever a customer has access to a mobile wireless network, including while on the move, through a mobile device, such as a smartphone. Fixed and mobile broadband providers (the Form 477) does not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands because it (1) captures nationwide broadband availability data— areas where providers may have broadband infrastructure—but does so in a way that leads to overstatements of availability, and (2) does not capture information on factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access on tribal lands, such as affordability, service quality, and denials of service. Nonetheless, FCC uses its Form 477 broadband availability data in annual broadband deployment reports to measure the percentage of Americans living on tribal lands with or without access to broadband and to target federal broadband funding to the tribal areas most in need. FCC does not collect data on service denials on the Form 477. In its Strategic Plan 2018–2022 and the National Broadband Plan, FCC identified increasing all Americans’ access to affordable broadband as a long-term, strategic goal FCC’s National Broadband Plan notes the importance of supporting tribal efforts to build technical expertise with respect to broadband issues, and federal internal control standards state that federal agencies should obtain quality information from external entities. Officials we interviewed in FCC’s Office of Native Affairs and Policy told us that they provide some outreach and technical assistance to tribal officials at regional and national workshops, and FCC officials stated that providers heavily redacted deployment information (which providers may consider proprietary) or required the tribe sign non-disclosure agreements to access deployment data. Additionally, a few tribally owned and non-tribal providers we interviewed told us that providers already maintain data for business purposes that would allow them to report more granular information on broadband availability. According to one tribal stakeholder, these non-disclosure agreements could possibly require tribes to waive tribal sovereign immunity in order to view the data. Some of the industry stakeholders we interviewed stated that if FCC were to solicit tribal input as part of its verification of the broadband data and maps, technical training and assistance could help tribes use and provide feedback on the data, or improve the collection and submission of their own data. FCC does not collect information on several factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access.

  " than half of the contracts reported needing more time to award the contracts than they initially anticipated. DOD contracting officials we surveyed for 23 of 37 contracts reported needing more time to award their contracts than anticipated at the time they issued their solicitation. Table 2 summarizes how respondents in our survey characterized differences between the anticipated contract award date and the actual date. DOD contracting officials cited the decision to make the award an office priority and contractor responsiveness as factors helping to decrease the overall time. In addition, contracting officials for four contracts awarded using full and open competition cited receiving waivers or deviations from relevant federal and service-level acquisition regulations as a factor that reduced the time. In case study interviews, contracting officials for two of these four contracts added that peer review waivers and delegation of the decision authority level to a lower level helped decrease the overall time. According to these contracting officials, they received these waivers because the procurements were considered low risk since the requirements that the offerors needed to meet were straightforward. DOD policy officials said peer review waivers are infrequently requested and granted on case-by-case bases.

The selected components in our review also differ in collecting data for interim phases of the contract award process—such as evaluation or negotiation. Both Navy commands capture multiple data points, such as when negotiations begin, among other events, but there is no common practice for including certain data across the commands that is provided to DOD. Table 1 shows the broad categories of information collected. Table 1 shows the broad categories of information collected. Concerns within the Air Force about the length of time taken to award contracts led to a process, begun in 2014, for tracking award times for sole-source contracts, including identifying practices and defining requirements, among others. We identified four contract phases subsequent to acquisition planning: solicitation, initial evaluation, discussion/negotiation, and contract award. See figure 1. Solicitation: Agencies solicit offers from prospective contractors by issuing a request for proposals. The request for proposals informs the prospective contractors of the government’s requirements, including the requirements for the solicitation of a contract. The request for proposals informs the prospective contractors of the government’s requirements for the solicitation of a contract, including the requirements for the solicitation of a contract and the requirements for the solicitation of a contract. Due to the fact that there is no common practice for measuring the time to award contracts and whether they collect data on interim dates between solicitation issuance and contract award, it is difficult for DOD to ensure that the data from the various components are comparable and comprehensive. This issue was highlighted in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which contained a provision for DOD to develop a definition of “procurement administrative lead time” to be used throughout the department and a plan for measuring and publicly reporting data on procurement administrative lead time. DOD proposed a definition for the procurement administrative lead time as the time between the date on which DOD issues the initial solicitation for a contract or task order and the date of the award in a February 2018 notice in the Federal Register. The proposed definition applies to DOD contracts and task orders above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. In addition to issuing the Federal Register notice, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy officials have started working with the military components (Army, Navy, and Air Force) to understand the information they have on the time frames for awarding contracts. Further, DOD officials stated that they are starting to identify bottlenecks within the procurement process as a common issue among the Navy contracting commands as well as the justification and approval cycle for sole-source awards. The analyses also included areas for improvement during the process, such as improving guidance and training for technical evaluation teams and exploring opportunities to streamline or waive some peer reviews. Naval Air Systems Command piloted the Procurement Management Tool in fiscal year 2013.

  " individuals applying to enroll in coverage under an SEP to verify their eligibility for the SEP prior to enrollment. CMS also stated that, starting in June 2017, it would allow issuers, subject to state law, to apply a new premium payment to an individual’s past due payments before applying that premium towards a new enrollment. CMS stated that issuers would be allowed to refuse to provide coverage to an enrollee applying under an SEP due to loss of existing coverage if the issuer had previously terminated the enrollee’s coverage for nonpayment of premiums, unless the enrollee paid the past due premiums. CMS further stated that this provision was intended to encourage individuals to maintain continuous coverage rather than start and stop coverage (and thereby avoid incurring past due premiums). Approximately 4.9 million enrollees (53 percent of the 9.2 million FFE enrollees in 2015) maintained continuous coverage throughout the year— that is, their coverage began between January 1 and March 1, 2015, and lasted through December 31, 2015. These individuals therefore had 10 or more months of continuous coverage, with an average length of coverage of 11.6 months. Most of these enrollees (83 percent) re-enrolled in coverage by June 2016. Approximately 4.9 million enrollees (53 percent of the 9.2 million FFE enrollees in 2015) maintained continuous coverage throughout the year— that is, their coverage began between January 1 and March 1, 2015, and lasted through December 31, 2015. These individuals therefore had 10 or more months of continuous coverage, with an average length of coverage of 11.6 months. Most of these enrollees (83 percent) re-enrolled in coverage by June 2016. The remaining 4.3 million enrollees (53 percent of the 9.2 million FFE enrollees in 2015) maintained continuous coverage throughout the year— that is, their coverage began between January 1 and March 1, 2015, and lasted through December 31, 2015.

These individuals therefore had 10 or more months of continuous coverage, with an average length of coverage of 11.6 months. Most of these enrollees (83 percent) re-enrolled in coverage by June 2016. CMS may terminate coverage if the agency is unable to verify key information such as citizenship status. CMS is also responsible for making payments for APTCs and determining whether an enrollee is eligible for any cost-sharing reductions that lower enrollees’ out-of- pocket costs for expenses, such as deductibles and copayments. Issuers are responsible for, among other things, collecting premiums from enrollees, arranging for coverage through provider networks, and paying claims. Issuers are also responsible for processing, and notifying CMS of, terminations related to nonpayment of premiums or fraud. As a result of this shared responsibility, CMS and issuers notify each other of coverage updates by transferring data back and forth through electronic files known as “transaction files.” It is critical that both issuers and CMS notify each other of coverage updates by transferring data back and forth through electronic files known as “transaction files.” When issuers terminate policies, the inbound transaction files they send to CMS must include, among other elements, a revised coverage end date taking the termination into account. CMS uploads these data into its centralized FFE enrollment system. However, while the issuers may also include codes that designate the reasons for the terminations, there is no requirement for them to consistently do so. Data on termination codes may therefore not be consistently reported by issuers. CMS officials told us that data on reasons for termination are not tracked because they are not critical to ensure the accuracy of APTC payments—which is the main function of the reconciliation process. Officials stated that key essential variables that CMS does track are whether coverage is effectuated (that is, whether the enrollee is eligible for APTC payments), whether the enrollee is eligible for APTC payments, and whether coverage was terminated. In addition, when issuers do report termination reason codes, these data are not always accurate. CMS could help ensure it has reliable and transparent data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums. CMS could help ensure it has reliable and transparent data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums. CMS could help ensure it has reliable and transparent data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums. In addition, CMS could help ensure it has reliable and transparent data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums, and it could use these data to assess the effects of CMS policies and the overall stability of the exchange. We compared data on terminations for nonpayment from CMS’s centralized enrollment system with data we obtained from three issuers for a small selection of enrollees. We found that key essential variables that CMS does track are whether coverage is effectuated (that is eligible for",
  " stated that these new rates may still not fully cover the cost of delivery in some countries with very high postal delivery costs, potentially impacting ECOs’ competitiveness in those countries. A representative from a small business that competes with overseas e- commerce businesses for U.S. consumers stated that any increase in terminal dues would make his business more price-competitive with foreign competitors. However, a representative from one small business affected by inbound terminal dues mail we spoke with stated that his business had already suffered due to the terminal dues system. He added that other factors also make it harder to compete and therefore it would be harder to recover even with higher terminal dues rates. While these changes may have different effects on U.S. stakeholders, it is difficult to quantify the future effects because of limited information and forecasting variability. As a result, it remains to be seen what the effects of these changes to this system will be on domestic stakeholders. During fiscal year 2016, inbound Express Mail Service products included shipments from 149 countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Canada, and France. During fiscal year 2016, inbound Express Mail Service products included shipments from 149 countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Canada, and France. Express Mail Service products provide express delivery of documents and merchandise, which take priority over other postal services and include signature confirmation and liability insurance for damaged or lost mail. Express Mail Service rates for inbound products can be set by bilateral agreements or determined by the receiving designated postal operator.

Express Mail Service products for outbound U.S. mail include Priority Mail Express International service, a high-speed USPS mail service available to certain countries and available at designated USPS facilities, and Global Express Guaranteed service, a USPS international expedited delivery service provided through an alliance with FedEx. As such, the UPU divides its member countries into country groups based on the UPU’s “postal development indicator,” which is largely based on gross national income per capita and attempts to factor in the cost to deliver a letter based on statistics from the United Nations, the World Bank, and the UPU. These studies also try to measure how terminal dues rate increases may affect these stakeholders. Our review determined that these models and analyses can help inform stakeholders about the different overall effects of terminal dues. However, we also found that the analyses are limited in how they can predict or describe the effect of the terminal dues system, in part due to a lack of complete information on the following issues: the volume of mail, including its type and weight, that flows between each UPU member country (see app. II for a list of the countries in each UPU country group). UPU limits the rates through caps and floors to minimize year-over-year variability. In addition to USPS, numerous domestic stakeholders are affected by especially for certain countries, which will increase by 13 percent per year specifically for packets. By 2021, all but the least developed countries will have the same terminal dues rates for packets. As the majority of terminal dues mail handled by USPS is inbound, the increase in revenue resulting from higher terminal dues may likely more than offset the increase in USPS’s costs that will result from increases in USPS’s costs that will result from increases in terminal dues rates to the countries where most USPS outbound terminal dues mail is sent. The UPU also created a new rate category for packets, in addition to a new tracked-packet surcharge, which will increase USPS’s revenue. We assessed the impact of the current terminal dues system on domestic stakeholders. We assessed the impact of the current terminal dues system on domestic stakeholders through interviews with USPS, State, PRC, and industry group officials and consultants and our review of mail stakeholder comments submitted to PRC pursuant to PRC proceedings on terminal dues and international mail related proposals and agreements. In addition, to select business and consultant stakeholders, we also reviewed published reports documenting their knowledge of international mail and terminal dues issues. We interviewed USPS and CBP officials and observed international mail processing by USPS and CBP at two USPS International Service Centers (ISC). We applied standard economic principles to describe effects of the current terminal dues system on domestic stakeholders.

The DOD officials also said that 800 parts per billion is the lowest level of PFOS and PFOA that can be detected in firefighting foam concentrate by current testing methods and technologies, but DOD is working with foam manufacturers and laboratories to achieve lower detection limits. According to the June 2018 report, DOD plans to establish lower limits for PFOS and PFOA in firefighting foam in late 2018. The June 2018 report reiterated that, according to DOD, no commercially available PFAS-free foam has met the performance requirements of the military specification, and the report also stated that DOD-funded research efforts to develop a PFAS-free foam that can meet performance requirements are still ongoing.

Total CRE concentration threshold: Total nonowner-occupied CRE loans (including CLD loans) represent 300 percent or more of a bank’s total capital and total CRE lending increased by 50 percent or more during the previous 36 months. According to the guidance, the CLD and CRE thresholds do not constitute limits on a bank’s CRE lending activity but rather serve as high-level indicators to identify banks potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. In 2011, we reported on how the federal banking regulators had responded to the potential risks of growing CRE concentrations at community banks, including by jointly issuing the 2006 CRE concentration guidance. We recommended that the regulators should enhance or supplement the 2006 CRE guidance and take steps to better ensure that such guidance is consistently applied. The regulators may extend the examination interval to 18 months. Out of the approximately 5,900 banks that had a CRE loan portfolio as of the end of June 2017, a total of 504 banks exceeded either 100 percent in CLD loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital, or 100 percent in CRE loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital.

The regulators may extend the examination interval to 18 months, generally for banks and thrifts that have less than $1 billion in total assets and that meet certain conditions, such as satisfactory ratings, are well capitalized, and are not being subject to a formal enforcement action. As part of a full-scope examination, examiners review a bank’s risk exposure within a number of components using the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, which also is referred to as the CAMELS rating system (capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk). Evaluations of CAMELS components consider a bank’s size and sophistication, the nature and complexity of its activities, and its risk profile. The end result of a full-scope, on-site examination is a report of examination, which includes the CAMELS ratings and other findings and is provided to the bank’s management and board of directors. A report of examination may include deficiencies or other issues that examiners found and that a bank is expected to address within specific time frames. Such issues generally are called supervisory recommendations by FDIC, supervisory findings by the Federal Reserve, and supervisory concerns by OCC. For purposes of this report, examiners reviewed and analyzed a range of data that they considered to be indicative of a bank’s risk management weaknesses. Examiners most frequently found risk management weaknesses in at least one of the seven internal control areas. Examiners most frequently found risk management weakness in three internal control areas: board and management oversight (11 instances), management information systems (8 instances), and stress testing (7 instances). To a slightly lesser extent, examiners found weaknesses in portfolio management, credit underwriting standards, and credit risk review function. Examiners communicated their supervisory concerns to these 15 banks in their reports of examinations. In 12 of the examinations, examiners included MRAs, MRBAs, or MRIAs in their reports of examination that directed the banks to correct their risk management weaknesses. In the other three examinations, examiners included recommendations or other notes in their reports of examination that generally directed the banks to correct their risk management weaknesses. In the other three examinations, examiners included recommendations or other notes in their reports of examination that generally directed the banks to correct their risk management weaknesses. Consistent with the 2006 CRE guidance, we found that examiners generally did not use the CLD or total CRE concentration thresholds as limits on bank CRE lending. With two exceptions, examiners did not direct banks that exceeded the CLD or CRE threshold to reduce their concentrations but rather focused on ensuring that the banks’ risk management practices were commensurate with the nature and level of their concentration risk. In the two exceptions, examiners found the banks’ practices and capital inadequate for managing their CLD or CRE concentration risk. In the two exceptions, we found that the banks’ practices and capital inadequate for managing their CLD or CRE concentration risk were commensurate with the nature and level of their concentration risk.

Absent applications or verified losses, Puerto Rico assumed that nonapplicants and applicants without verified losses had some level of unmet needs. Puerto Rico estimated these potential unmet needs to be approximately $5.8 billion. To estimate unmet needs, HUD then multiplied the number of units it identified as having major-low, major-high, and severe damage to account for owners and renters that did not apply to FEMA and FEMA applicants without verified losses. HUD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We considered three comments to be more than technical in nature. HUD concurred with our recommendation and has since updated its policies and procedures to require that nonapplicants and applicants without verified losses. Puerto Rico estimated these potential unmet needs to be approximately $5.8 billion. HUD officials told us that there were a significant number of FEMA applicants who were denied in Puerto Rico due to an inability to prove property ownership. However, the draft report identified grantee capacity as an administrative challenge that CDBG-DR grantees face that is not related to the lack of permanent statutory authority. The HUD OIG also has conducted numerous audits of the internal controls of prior CDBG-DR funds. This is because HUD’s estimate of unmet needs was used to allocate funds to grantees and grantees’ estimates were used to target their funding. HUD also noted that there was more than one way to determine unmet needs and that it was acceptable for grantees to use different methodologies to reflect their local circumstances. According to HUD officials, all four grantees had entered into grant agreements with HUD for their initial 2017 CDBG-DR funds. As of January 2019, all four grantees had entered into grant agreements with HUD for their initial 2017 CDBG-DR funds. In written feedback that HUD provided to the grantee on its capacity assessment, the HUD reviewer asked for more comprehensive analysis of staffing needs and to include a rationale for the number of staff to be assigned to each function. Yet, other feedback HUD provided focused on whether certain information was included rather than on the quality of the information. For example, when reviewing the grantee’s financial processes and procedures, the reviewer pointed out that the grantee had not shown that it had addressed prior audit findings. In another instance, the reviewer asked the grantee to include additional information in the section of its action plan on unmet needs, but did not focus on the grantee’s methodology. According to a HUD official, this documentation was not readily available for each grantee because it is not part of the official administrative record. Even if readily available, such documentation likely would not substantiate HUD’s conclusions that grantees’ submissions and estimates were sufficient.

TSA inspectors also prepare a report in TSA’s Global Risk Analysis and Decision Support System (GRADS) detailing their findings on the airport’s overall security posture and security measures, which may contain recommendations for corrective actions or the inspectors were busy conducting other inspections. As of December 2017, TSA officials reported that certain foreign airports took corrective actions to address noncompliance issues. As a result, TSA assigns a vulnerability score to each ICAO standard and recommended practice assessed, as well as an overall vulnerability score for the airport, which corresponds to the level of compliance for each ICAO standard and recommended practice TSA assesses. According to our analysis of TSA data, for the remaining 60 percent of noncompliance issues, the airports have not yet taken sufficient action to fully address TSA’s concerns, or TSA inspectors have not yet verified whether the actions foreign airports reported that they have taken are sufficient for addressing the noncompliance issues. As of December 2017, TSA officials reported that certain foreign airports took corrective actions to address noncompliance issues. As a result, TSA closed out approximately 40 percent of the fiscal year 2012 through 2017 deficiencies identified, as well as an overall vulnerability score for the airport, which corresponds to the level of compliance for each ICAO standard and recommended practice TSA assesses. According to our analysis of TSA data, for the remaining 60 percent of noncompliance issues, the airports have not yet taken sufficient action to fully address TSA’s concerns, or TSA inspectors have not yet verified whether the actions foreign airports reported that they have taken are sufficient for addressing the noncompliance issues. At the request of TSA, air carriers must provide evidence of compliance with applicable security requirements and its security programs. These standards and recommended practices include ensuring that passengers and cargo are properly screened and that unauthorized individuals do not have access to restricted areas of the airport. TSA uses a risk-informed approach to schedule foreign airport assessments. TSA uses a risk-informed approach to schedule foreign airport assessments, generally every 1 to 3 years, with high risk airports assessed more frequently than medium and low risk airports. Although TSA is authorized under U.S. law to conduct foreign airport assessments at intervals it considers necessary, it may not perform an assessment of security measures at a foreign airport without permission from the host government. TSA also does not have authority to impose or otherwise enforce security requirements at a foreign airport without permission from the host government.

According to TSA data, if a TSA inspector finds that an air carrier is not in compliance with any applicable security requirements, additional steps are to be taken to correct and record those specific violations, which can include providing on-the-spot counseling for minor violations or opening an investigation if the violation is potentially more serious. Upon conclusion of the investigation, TSA is to make a determination whether to issue a warning notice, letter of correction, or notice of proposed civil penalty. In 2012, we reported on the actions TSA took to enhance the security of U.S.-bound air cargo after the October 2010 discovery of explosive devices in packages on all-cargo aircraft bound for the United States from Yemen. We recommended, among other things, that DHS assess the costs and benefits of requiring all-cargo carriers to report U.S.-bound air cargo screening data. DHS agreed with our recommendation and TSA reported that, although all-cargo air carriers submit data to TSA as part of the Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) pilot, the all-cargo air carriers do not need to report on the number of shipments screened for explosives. Nevertheless, TSA has not yet taken sufficient action to correct and record those specific violations. For example, TSA could measure the extent to which air carriers are not in compliance with any applicable security requirements. For example, TSA could not",
  "According to tribal officials, the Leech Lake tribal government applied several years for a decision from FCC on their ETC application. The tribal officials told us that if FCC did not make a decision soon, the tribal government would need to shut down the broadband network, as the tribe’s original decision to fund the network assumed there would be a CAF subsidy to help defray the costs. The Leech Lake reservation is rural with low population density and is surrounded by the Chippewa National Forest. Subsequent to our meeting with the tribe in November 2017, the tribe withdrew its application in March 2018, noting that it was ceasing its attempt to run its telecommunications company specifically “due to inaction” by FCC. According to representatives from a tribal association we contacted, FCC has provided ETCs with billions of dollars to deploy service to unserved areas through the Universal Service Fund programs, but FCC’s efforts have not always been successful in the hardest to reach areas, particularly tribal lands. The representatives noted that FCC’s competitive market approach does not work where competition cannot be supported and that there needs to be a different approach. Similarly, tribal officials from Idaho told us that rural service providers are able to operate due to CAF support, but the tribe is not eligible to receive those subsidies. Officials said although the provider in their area has received millions of dollars in CAF subsidies, it has not always been successful in the hardest to reach areas, particularly tribal lands.

Similarly, tribal officials from Idaho told us that rural service providers are able to operate due to CAF support, but the tribe is not eligible to receive those subsidies. Officials said although the provider in their area has received millions of dollars in CAF subsidies, it has not deployed broadband on the tribal lands. Broadband infrastructure may include burying fiber-optic or copper cables, stringing cable on existing poles, or erecting towers for wireless microwave links, which relay wireless Internet connections from tower to tower. Figure 1 illustrates some of the options for broadband deployment infrastructure. To install this infrastructure, providers must obtain federal grants, including (1) private providers; (2) a community access network provider; (3) an electric cooperative; (4) a regional consortium; and (5) tribally owned telecommunications companies (which we will refer to as tribally owned providers). These types of arrangements are explained below. Outcomes of these partnership arrangements varied, as reported by tribal officials and other stakeholders we According to Nez Perce and Inland Cellular officials, the partnership resulted in broadband service being provided to previously underserved rural communities and 17 community institutions, including schools and public safety organizations. Because the partners each own towers on the reservation, the officials told us they could collocate equipment on each other’s towers, an approach that resulted in more reliable service. Further, Nez Perce officials and Inland Cellular representatives told us that their partnership was complementary, in that Inland Cellular offered voice services and the tribe’s enterprise offered data services. Further, Nez Perce officials and Inland Cellular representatives told us that their partnership was complementary, in that Inland Cellular offered voice services and the tribe’s enterprise offered data services. We have previously reported that regional consortium, which are typically formed by groups to undertake an enterprise beyond the resources of any one member, can sponsor regional networks that focus on building broadband networks and providing broadband services. For example, rather than having one choice for Internet service, in that Inland Cellular offered voice services and the tribe’s enterprise offered data services. Community access network providers. Community access network providers are typically owned and operated by public entities rather than by a private corporation. All profits are reinvested to operate, maintain, and expand the community network. Community access networks focus on building broadband infrastructure that allows multiple Internet service providers to offer their services to customers. For example, rather than having one choice for Internet service, community access network providers will allow several service providers to compete for customers. Northwest Open Access Network (NoaNet). NoaNet, a utility network that offers communities access to broadband infrastructure, has deployed infrastructure in rural areas of Washington State, including on tribal lands. These stakeholders were selected based on their exposure to broadband issues on tribal lands. Noa",
  "VHA’s OSI metric data shows that not all facilities had access to VISN academic detailing services, which, according to VHA, can help ensure that providers follow opioid risk mitigation strategies. Of the 25 veterans with the highest risk of an adverse event, such as a suicide, overdose, fall, or opioid-induced respiratory depression, based on their Stratified Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM) risk score: 4 veterans were prescribed a non-pharmacological therapy; 7 veterans were prescribed naloxone; 16 veterans had a maintenance follow-up visit; and 5 of 17 veterans who had a change in their opioid medication had a follow-up visit between 14 and 28 days following the medication change. There are a variety of reasons that VHA providers may not always follow clinical practice guideline recommendations. According to VHA officials, pain management is a critical role in opioid safety and can help providers remedy gaps in pain care management for individual patients, such as gaps in pain care management for individual patients, such as incomplete opioid risk mitigation strategies. There are a variety of reasons that VHA providers may not always follow clinical practice guideline recommendations. For example, the availability of these non-pharmacological therapies may be limited, according to officials at all five selected VHA medical facilities.

For example, the availability of these non-pharmacological therapies may be limited, according to officials at all five selected VHA medical facilities. Officials at some facilities noted that the availability of these therapies can be particularly challenging for facilities in rural areas. VHA officials explained that the biggest barrier to providing naloxone is educating providers, so that they consistently consider prescribing naloxone for their patients receiving opioid therapy. According to officials, an education course for providers on naloxone prescribing became available in December 2015, and naloxone education efforts are a key focus of academic detailing programs. According to VHA data, since fiscal year 2014, naloxone distribution has increased. VHA data, since fiscal year 2014, naloxone distribution has increased. Specifically, as of March 2018, the agency has dispensed almost 142,000 naloxone kits to veterans, an increase of about 58 percent since June 2017. VHA is taking important steps under the OSI to help ensure that veterans receive safe care. For example, VHA has begun tracking and publicly reporting data on four key metrics related to opioid prescription rates, and these data show that opioid prescription rates have decreased since 2013, which could hinder identification of non-adherence to these strategies.

These strategies are intended to help ensure that patients at VHA medical facilities are safely prescribed opioid medications. Overall, based on our review of 103 veterans at five selected facilities, we found that 75 percent of the veterans in our sample had an annual urine screening, 26 percent had their names queried in a PDMP, and 70 percent provided informed consent. VHA officials said that the issuance of this guidance made the VISN-required action irrelevant. In addition, VHA OSI metric data show that there has been a 6.6 percentage point decrease nationally in the percentage of patients dispensed an opioid and benzodiazepine from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

  "SPV-NG program office should, with input from SAC, develop, document, and communicate to stakeholders an overarching strategy for the program, including how the program office will prioritize categories of supplies for future phases of requirement development and contracting. VA agreed with this recommendation and reported it would have a strategy in place by December 2017. Leadership instability and workforce challenges also made it difficult for VA to execute its transition to MSPV-NG. Our work has shown that leadership buy-in is necessary to ensure that major programs like MSPV- NG have the resources and support they need to execute their missions. Due to a combination of budget and hiring constraints, and lack of prioritization within VA, the MSPV-NG program office has never been fully staffed and has experienced instability in its leadership. As of January 2017, 24 of the office’s 40 positions were filled, and program office officials stated that this lack of staff affected their ability to implement certain aspects of the program within the planned time frames. In addition, since the inception of MSPV-NG, the program office has had four directors, two of whom were acting and two of whom were fulfilling the director position while performing other collateral duties. For instance, one of the acting MSPV-NG program office directors was on detail from a regional health network to fulfill the position, but had to abruptly leave and return to her prior position due to a federal hiring freeze. In addition, since the inception of MSPV-NG, the program office has had four directors, two of whom were acting and VA’s Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC)—a VA-wide contracting organization—and logistics and clinical personnel at every medical center. The program also includes hundreds of new contracts with individual supply vendors and a new set of collateral duties.

The program also includes hundreds of new contracts with individual supply vendors and a new set of prime vendor contracts to distribute the supplies. VA’s goals for the MSPV-NG program office have not been achieved. VA’s goals for the MSPV-NG program office have not been achieved. VA’s goals for the MSPV-NG program include (1) standardizing requirements for supply items for greater clinical consistency; (2) demonstrating cost avoidance by leveraging VA’s substantial buying power when making competitive awards; (3) achieving greater efficiency in ordering and supply chain management, including a metric of ordering 40 percent of medical centers’ supplies from the MSPV-NG formulary; and (4) involving clinicians in requirements development to ensure uniform clinical review of medical supplies. VHA launched the MSPV-NG program in December 2016, but allowed a number of medical centers to participate in the program. When VA’s MSPV-NG initial formulary was established in December 2016, each medical center was charged with implementing it. According to logistics officials we spoke with at selected medical centers, they had varying levels of success due, in part, to incomplete guidance from the program office. Because they were made on a non-competitive basis, the Phase 1 agreements were established for a period of 1 year. In order to keep the full formulary available, the SAC director said the Phase 1 agreements were established for a period of 1 year. In order to keep the full formulary available, the SAC director said the staff must award 200 to 250 contracts before the Phase 1 agreements expire later this year. SAC officials acknowledged that it is unlikely that they will be able to award the contracts by the time the existing agreements expire. According to SAC officials, they are in the process of hiring more staff to deal with the increased workload. Further, the SAC division director told us that they canceled all outstanding Phase 2 solicitations in September 2017 due to low response rates, protests from service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and changes in overall MSPV-NG strategy. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the MSPV-NG program office and SAC should establish a plan for how to mitigate the potential risk of gaps in contract coverage. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the MSPV-NG program office and SAC should establish a plan for how to mitigate the potential risk of gaps in contract coverage while SAC is still working to make competitive Phase 2 awards, which could include prioritizing supply categories that are most likely to yield cost avoidance. VA agreed with this recommendation and indicated that it is unlikely that they will be able to",
  "s data center consolidation cost savings information, we used the latest version of each agency’s update of the August 2017 quarterly cost savings report and DCOI strategic plan. We also reviewed the quarterly reports and DCOI strategic plans for missing data and other errors, such as missing cost-savings information. In addition, we compared agencies cost savings and avoidances with data from our most recent data center consolidation report. Further, we obtained written responses from agency officials regarding the steps taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their cost savings data. As a result, we determined that the data were sufficiently complete and reliable to report on agencies data center consolidation cost-savings information. For our third objective, we analyzed the August 2017 data center optimization progress information of the 24 DCOI agencies. This progress information was obtained from the IT Dashboard—an OMB public website that provides information on federal agencies’ major IT investments. We then compared the agencies’ optimization progress information against OMB’s data center optimization targets, as documented in its August 2016 memorandum. As shown in table 3, Transportation’s Director for IT Compliance stated that the department was working with OMB to establish a revised closure goal. In contrast, officials from Interior’s Office of the Chief Information Officer stated that a number of the department’s non-tiered data centers were either mission critical or not cost effective to close. Thus, the officials said Interior was working with OMB to establish a revised closure goal. In contrast, officials from Interior’s Office of the Chief Information Officer stated that a number of the department’s non-tiered data centers were either mission critical or not cost effective to close. Thus, the officials said Interior was working with OMB to establish a revised closure goal. Because OMB’s closure targets required agencies to close a certain percentage of their data centers, basing agency goals on an outdated inventory (that did not include the additional facilities) does not give a true picture of progress towards consolidation of data centers. As detailed in our report, when DCOI was launched in August 2016, agencies reported an overall inventory of 9,995 data centers. For example, each agency was required to develop cost savings targets due to consolidation and optimization actions and report any realized cost savings. Further, our analysis determined that it may not always be realistic for an agency to meet OMB’s targets. For example, NSF, which does not have any tiered data centers, reported that it plans to close one (50 percent) of its two non-tiered data centers. However, the only way to meet OMB’s 60 percent threshold would be for the agency to close both of its non-tiered data centers. However, the only way to meet OMB’s 60 percent threshold would be for the agency to close both of its non-tiered data centers, which may not be an option, depending on the services provided by that one remaining center. Although OMB’s stated time frame for closing data centers currently remains as the end of fiscal year 2018, the recent extension of FITARA’s data center consolidation and optimization provisions through fiscal year 2020 provides agencies additional OMB began requiring the implementation of these monitoring tools in August 2016; however, as of August 2017, these 9 agencies had not reported that they had implemented the tools at any data centers. However, the effective date of the updated data (February 2018) is outside the scope of our review, which relied solely on data reported in August 2017, as detailed in appendix I. While we recognize the department’s efforts to ensure that its past reporting is updated and as accurate as possible, our report only presents data as reported by agencies in August 2017. Consequently, we believe that the achieved cost savings for Interior accurately reflect what the department reported at the time of our review. We also noted that, although federal standards emphasize the need to establish plans to help ensure goals are met, none of the 18 agencies had fully documented plans for implementing automated monitoring tools. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB formally document a requirement for agencies to include plans, as part of existing OMB reporting mechanisms, to implement automated monitoring tools at their agency-owned data centers. We also recommended that the 18 agencies without fully documented plans take action, within existing OMB reporting mechanisms, to complete plans describing how they intend to achieve OMB’s requirement to implement automated monitoring tools at all agency-owned data centers by the end of fiscal year 2018. We also recommended that the 18 agencies without fully documented plans take action, within existing OMB reporting mechanisms, to complete plans describing how they intend to achieve OMB’s requirement to implement automated monitoring tools at all agency-owned data centers by the end of fiscal year 2018. Of the 19 agencies (including OMB) to which we made recommendations, 10 agreed with our recommendations, 3 partially agreed, and 6 did not state whether they agreed or disagreed. We also noted that",
  " from the discontinued IHiS project, share them with the new project management team, and ensure lessons learned are utilized for the future EHR effort. The Coast Guard’s clinical staff perform various manual steps to process each paper health record. For example, clinical staff schedule appointments for patients using Microsoft Outlook’s calendar feature and provide the patient with paper forms for completion upon his or her arrival. In addition, clinical staff must handwrite clinical notes in the paper health record during the appointment, as well as handwrite prescriptions, among other manual processes. In response to our survey, the 12 HSWL Regional Managers identified a number of challenges that clinics and sick bays in their regions had experienced in managing and maintaining paper health records. These challenges were grouped into 16 categories. In addition, ensuring established project management and governance processes are effective, as well as documenting and sharing lessons learned, will be essential in avoiding past mistakes and helping to ensure a successful implementation of a future EHR solution at the Coast Guard. Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have.

In addition, the Department of Defense’s (DOD) Defense Health Agency Solution Delivery Information Technology (IT) team independently validate the IHiS timelines and the status of the project in 2015 because of the identified technical risks and concerns as to whether the system would be ready to be piloted in the fall of 2015. In this regard, 34 of the survey respondents reported that not all records from the Coast Guard legacy EHR systems were printed out and included in patients’ paper health records as required before the systems were retired.

WMATA officials identify staffing levels needed by individual departments annually, in preparation for WMATA’s annual budget. WMATA does not have sufficient controls in place to ensure that supervisors accurately complete performance reviews and submit them to the human resources department within established timeframes. WMATA does not have sufficient controls in place to ensure that supervisors accurately complete performance reviews and submit them to the human resources department within established timeframes. WMATA human resources officials said that for the 2016 review cycle, they emailed a report to supervisors listing year-end performance reviews that were due within 90 days, but did not subsequently ensure that they were completed correctly and on time. Officials said that once supervisors emailed these reviews to the human resources department, human resources staff manually recorded these reviews into WMATA’s personnel information system. WMATA officials told us that human resources staff examined the performance reviews for completion and accuracy. Despite this process, WMATA officials could not provide us reliable information on the number of positions allotted to them in the previous fiscal year. WMATA officials said the budget office assembles this department-level data into WMATA’s agency-wide budget request for the board of directors. WMATA’s annual budget request for the Board of Directors, WMATA officials told us the agency’s annual budget request for the Board of Directors, WMATA officials told us the agency’s annual budget request for the Board of Directors, WMATA officials told us the agency’s annual budget request for the Board of Directors. WMATA has established competencies as part of its PERFORMetro system, these competencies are defined in a uniform manner that does not reflect the varied job responsibilities of its employees. Inclusion of such competencies tailored to each position’s responsibilities is a leading practice for an effective performance management system. Competencies, which define the skills and supporting behaviors that individuals are expected to exhibit to carry out their work effectively can provide a fuller picture of an individual’s performance. WMATA defines four competencies for all employees under PERFORMetro—”focuses on safety,” “serves customers,” “accountability,” and “teamwork.” However, these competencies are defined in a uniform manner that does not reflect the varied job responsibilities of WMATA’s employees. WMATA’s performance management systems are not uniform in their design. WMATA’s performance management systems are not uniform in their design.

  "’s charter, the team will work to modify human resources processes and move toward enterprise service delivery of human resources services, which is expected to reduce costs. Team members told us that their initial focus is to carry out projects focusing on high-priority challenges, such as pursuing the optimal IT systems for DOD human resources services department-wide and identifying legislative and regulatory changes needed to streamline processes and procedures. After progress is made in these areas, the team plans to review service delivery across the department and determine the most effective and efficient system. Senior leaders from the human resources directorates of DFAS, DLA, and WHS all stated that increased consolidation was possible, if properly reviewed and implemented, especially for tasks such as entering personnel data and other hiring-related tasks, which could be conducted through a shared service model. This work may lead to increased coordination among, or consolidation of one or more, organizations. DOD has not assessed or identified the most effective, economic, or efficient provision of this business function. DOD officials stated that assessing the most effective, economical, and efficient model of human resources service delivery within the department. (Recommendation 4) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the CMO, through the human resources management reform team, collects information on the overhead costs charged by all DOD human resources service providers to assist in determining the most effective, economical, and efficient model of human resources service delivery within the department. (Recommendation 4) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the CMO routinely and comprehensively monitors and evaluates ongoing efficiency initiatives within the department, such as the development of a report that responds to the requirement. At the time of our review, section 192(c) of title 10, United States Code, did not explicitly require that DOD develop and issue a written report as part of the required periodic review. DOD has not assessed or identified the most effective, economic, or efficient provision of this business function. DOD officials stated that assessing the provision of human resources in the department has not previously been a priority of senior leadership. In its written comments, DOD stated that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 gives the CMO additional specific authorities; substantially rewrites the requirements of section 192(c); and addresses the findings and recommendations in our report. Specifically, this required a “time-to-hire” and “cost-effective way forward,” with outcomes and time frames for converting the mission to an enterprisewide service delivery model. The new reform team reflects a commitment from senior leaders within the department to address longstanding problems in the human resources area. However, we identified limitations in how the human resources management reform team is planning and managing its work. First, one goal of the human resources management reform team must be re-entered through a different connection to the data system, and other administrative steps are re-performed, such as providing the employee a new Common Access Card, the department’s identification badge used for facility and computer system access. Additionally, DOD officials stated that there are more than 800,000 employees in the Department of Defense, and the Department of Defense does not have a single CMO. However, considering the size and scope of the Fourth Estate, which DOD reported includes more than $100 billion in funding annually, identifying comprehensive information regarding the extent of inefficient overhead costs would be important information for the reform team to consider in addressing inefficiencies and pursuing enterprise-wide solutions to determine the most effective, economical, and efficient model of service delivery. Further, DOD stated the department is on track to achieve substantial savings through its reform team efforts and CMO emphasis on strong management practices, integrated processes, and best value business investments. In contrast to DOD’s biennial reports on DAFAs for 10 U.S.C. § 192(c), we found that the DOD combat support agency reports for 10 U.S.C. § 193(a) we reviewed generally reflect key elements of quality evaluations that we identified. For example, the most recent combat support agency reports we reviewed generally have clear evaluation questions, use sufficient and appropriate data, use sufficient and appropriate data, and support conclusions with data and analysis. Additionally, all of the DOD combat support agency reports we reviewed generally reflect key elements of quality evaluations that we identified. The most recent DOD combat support agency reports for 10 U.S.C. § 193(a) we reviewed generally reflect key elements of quality evaluations that we identified. Although DOD has not consistently ensured that the agency established a baseline from which to measure progress, use sufficient and appropriate data, and support conclusions with data and analysis. Last, all of the DOD combat support agency reports we reviewed contain actionable recommendations. Recommendations from the Joint Staff included in combat support agency reports resulted in reported efficiencies.

  "State is the lead agency involved in implementing American foreign policy and representing the United States abroad. While State’s data show persistent vacancies in both generalist and specialist positions at overseas posts, specialist positions remain vacant at a higher rate. State’s data show that 12 percent (680 of 5,660) of overseas Foreign Service generalist positions were vacant as of March 31, 2018, a slight decrease from the 14 percent of overseas Foreign Service generalist positions that we reported vacant in 2012. State’s data also show that 14.2 percent (594 of 4,188) of all overseas Foreign Service specialist positions were vacant, close to the 14.8 percent vacancy rate that we reported in 2012. State’s data show persistent vacancies in Foreign Service generalist positions responsible for analysis, engagement, and reporting at overseas posts. As shown in table 1, among Foreign Service generalist career tracks, the political, economic, and “other” tracks had the largest percentage of vacant positions, with, respectively, 20 percent, 16 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent of positions vacant as of March 31, 2018. Our 2012 report noted vacancies in the same three career tracks. Political officers at overseas posts are responsible for collecting and analyzing information on political events, engaging with foreign governments and reporting back to State headquarters. As shown in table 1, among Foreign Service generalist career tracks, the political, economic, and “other” tracks had the largest percentage of vacant positions, with, respectively, 20 percent, 16 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent of positions vacant as of March 31, 2018. Our 2012 report noted vacancies in the same three career tracks. To examine vacancies in State’s Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, we analyzed State’s personnel data on Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts from the department’s Global Employment Management System (GEMS), as of March 2018. Our analysis of the GEMS data includes Foreign Service positions filled by permanent Foreign Service employees as well as positions with higher relative importance to U.S. economic, national security, and other foreign policy interests; and (5) positions in a range of geographic locations by State region. To examine vacancies in State’s Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, we analyzed State’s personnel data from the department’s Global Employment Management System (GEMS), as of March 2018. Economic officers at overseas posts work with foreign governments and other U.S. agencies on technology, science, economic, trade, and environmental issues. The “other” generalist career track includes positions designated as “Executive” or “International Relations,” which, according to State officials, may be filled by generalists from any of State’s five career tracks. However, as noted in our 2012 report, State generally does not use this authority, preferring other means of filling high-priority positions, according to State officials. The process of assigning Foreign Service employees to their positions typically begins when they receive a list of upcoming vacancies for which they may compete. Foreign Service employees then submit a list of vacancies for which they may compete. This list of vacancies is used as a basis for evaluating, assessing, or enhancing trade and investment relationships with the United States. Vacancies in the political and economic career tracks at overseas posts could adversely affect State’s ability to achieve two of the goals in State and USAID’s joint strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 through 2022—(1) renew America’s competitive advantage for sustained economic growth and job creation and (2) promote American leadership through balanced engagement. According to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts may heighten the level of security risk at the posts and disrupt post operations. According to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts may heighten the level of security risk at the posts and disrupt post operations. Among Foreign Service specialist skill groups with the highest number of vacant positions, security officer, office management specialist, and information management had the largest percentages of vacant positions—16 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent, respectively—as of March 31, 2018.

  "Various DOJ and federal judiciary stakeholders play key roles in the federal criminal justice process, and as such, they can also have key roles in considering whether to use incarceration alternatives for a given offender or inmate. For example, in the course of the federal criminal justice process, a U.S. attorney is involved in the process of investigating, charging and prosecuting an offender, among other responsibilities. Federal defenders are called upon to represent defendants who are unable to financially retain counsel in federal criminal proceedings. The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Office (PPSO), an office within the judiciary, also has responsibilities including supervising an offender pretrial or after conviction. Federal judges are responsible for determining an offender’s sentence, and, in the case of incarceration, BOP is responsible for caring for the inmate while in custody. Federal laws and guidelines determine what, if any, incarceration is appropriate for offenders. The U.S. Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established the independent U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) within the judicial branch and charged it with, among other things, developing federal sentencing guidelines. The guidelines specify sentencing guideline ranges—a range of time (in months) that offenders should serve and, in the case of incarceration, BOP is responsible for caring for the inmate while in custody. Federal laws and guidelines determine what, if any, incarceration is appropriate for offenders. The U.S. Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established the independent U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) within the judicial branch and charged it with, among other things, developing federal sentencing guidelines. The guidelines specify sentencing guideline ranges—a range of time (in months) that offenders should serve and a range of time (in years) that can be imposed upon individuals with nonviolent drug convictions (NVDC). Our review of the NICCC found that, as of December 31, 2016, there were 641 collateral consequences in federal laws and regulations that can be triggered by NVDC. The NICCC data indicated that these 641 collateral consequences can limit many aspects of an individual’s life, such as employment, business licenses, education, and government benefits. For example, individuals may be ineligible for certain professional licenses, federal education loans, or federal food assistance. Moreover, we found that the NICCC identified that 78 percent of these 641 collateral consequences can potentially last a lifetime. We also reported on selected stakeholders’ views. We spoke to 14 individuals who were leaders of organizations representing judges, victims of crime, and states, among others—on actions the federal government could consider to mitigate these collateral consequences. Most of the stakeholders that we interviewed—13 of 14—said it was important for the federal government to take action to mitigate federal collateral consequences, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant’s history, and the need for deterrence, among other sentencing goals. As we reported in June 2016, alternatives to incarceration were available at various steps in the federal criminal justice process Title 9 of the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual permits U.S. Attorneys’ Offices to divert, at the discretion of a U.S. Attorney, certain federal offenders from prosecution into a program of supervision and services administered by the PPSO. The second initiative we addressed in our June 2015 report was the Clemency Initiative, which encourages nonviolent, low-level federal offenders to petition to have their sentences commuted, or reduced, by the President. Commutation of sentence, as we reported, has long been considered to be an extraordinary remedy that is rarely granted. According to DOJ, in 2013, then-President Obama expressed a desire to review more petitions, and DOJ pledged to expedite the review of such petitions in order to provide them to the President for consideration. Most of the stakeholders that we interviewed—13 of 14—said it was important for the federal government to take action to mitigate these collateral consequences, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant’s history, and the need for deterrence, among other sentencing goals. DOJ concurred, but in March 2017 DOJ reported to us that it had not tracked how long it takes for petitions to clear each step in its review process or identified and addressed any processes that may contribute to unnecessary delays. DOJ concurred, but in March 2017 DOJ stated that it had no standard review process to address this deficiency.

  " reviews found that for at least one loan reviewed, “the Lender failed to document justification that credit was unavailable elsewhere.” Another review found that for “three SBA Express loans and one Small Loan Advantage loan reported “other factors relating to the credit that in the lender’s opinion cannot be overcome except for the guaranty’ without specific identification of the factors.” Based on our review of on-site review reports and an interview with one reviewer, the key factors underlying lenders’ high rate of noncompliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement were lenders’ lack of proper internal controls and procedures and lack of awareness of the credit elsewhere documentation requirement. One reason why SBA does not routinely collect complete information on lenders’ use of the credit elsewhere criteria is that SBA does not routinely collect complete information on lenders’ use of the credit elsewhere criteria.

In addition, contractors conducting the on- site reviews with whom we spoke stated that some lenders appeared to be unfamiliar with SBA’s standard operating procedures or were unclear on how to interpret them. For the 11 on-site reviews conducted in 2016 that included corrective actions, SBA generally required lenders to improve controls or procedures. For the 11 on-site reviews conducted in 2016 that included corrective actions, SBA generally required lenders to improve controls or procedures. For example, one lender was required to “correct its policy, modify its procedure, and amend its internal controls, obtain relevant data from reliable internal and external sources in a timely manner, and process the obtained data into quality information.” For the 11 on-site reviews conducted in 2016 that included corrective actions, SBA generally required lenders to improve controls or procedures. For the 11 on-site reviews conducted in 2016 that included corrective actions, SBA generally required lenders to improve controls or procedures. For example, SBA issued a general requirement for lenders to “correct its policy, modify its procedure, and amend its internal controls to ensure that its consideration and documentation of credit unavailable elsewhere identifies the specific fact(s) which are applicable to the specific loan and the determination is rendered and accurate for each individual SBA loan that it originates.” Another lender was required to “improve underwriting processes and controls to ensure that the borrower meets the credit elsewhere requirement and, in turn, help the agency ensure compliance with the requirement. In this context, generalizable data, which can be collected through random sampling, or complete data through required reporting for every loan would allow SBA to better understand patterns in lender practices across the 7 Another lender representative cited the lack of collateral as the most common criterion used. Another lender representative cited the lack of collateral as the most common criterion used. Additionally, representatives at an industry association told us that one of the most commonly used criteria was the one related to loan maturity and many small businesses seek 7(a) loans because they offer repayment terms of up to 10 years, compared to 1 to 3 years for conventional loans. Representatives of two other lenders suggested that the credit elsewhere criteria should not be overly prescriptive, which could limit lenders’ ability to make 7(a) loans to some businesses. For example, one representative said the credit elsewhere criteria should remain flexible because banks have different lending policies. In addition, we interviewed two additional lenders that represented an industry group – one larger bank and one small bank. As a result, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria.

This type of information could provide them a better sense of what to expect when they resettle in the United States, according to officials. Based on our review, we found that while the materials discuss resettlement challenges generally, such as difficulties associated with relocating in certain high-cost areas or the likelihood that SIV holders will need to take an entry-level job instead of one in their professional field, they do not contain specific details, examples, or links to specific information. Officials from Opening Doors Sacramento, an affiliate of Church World Service, told us that they assist women who are special immigrant visa (SIV) holders and refugees convert their homes into home-based childcare centers. They provide minimal information on the amounts people may receive in government assistance or the extent to which they can expect assistance with such things as longer-term training or education. The SIV program for Iraqis who worked for or on behalf of the U.S. government, and as a consequence experienced or are experiencing an ongoing serious threat, have had larger numbers of visas allocated but are temporary in nature and require legislation to extend the programs. The SIV program for Iraqis who worked for or on behalf of the U.S. government stopped accepting new applications after fiscal year 2014. The SIV program for Iraqis who worked for or on behalf of the U.S. government stopped accepting new applications after fiscal year 2014. The SIV program for Afghans who worked for or on behalf of the U.S. government continued to accept new applications as of November 2017, and most recently, was allocated additional visas in December 2017. For all of these SIV programs, prospective special immigrants must go through multiple steps as required by the particular program to which they are applying, such as (1) providing a letter of recommendation from the direct U.S. citizen employment supervisor, (2) a statement describing the threats the applicant has received as a result of his or her U.S. government employment, and (3) forms and documents for all family members applying for visas. Additionally, applicants must have an in- person interview with a U.S. consular officer and have fingerprints taken at a U.S. embassy or consular office, among other steps in the process. The Iraqi and Afghan SIV application process has been subject to criticism due in part to the length of time it has taken some applications to be processed.

While there are no national guidelines for affordability, officials from one national resettlement agency said that their general rule is to find housing that a family could afford on their expected income and have extra for other expenses. Some groups we spoke with used strategies to help address housing challenges. Accordingly, one of ORR’s policy objectives is to improve data collection in order to make data-driven decisions to better support the populations it serves. Similarly, a primary goal of HHS’ redesign of the Annual Survey of Refugees is to maximize the effectiveness of ORR’s policies and programs in promoting successful integration for its populations. Without longer-term data or other in-depth research, neither ORR nor policymakers have information as to whether SIV holders have progressed beyond the immediate goal of basic self-sufficiency toward improved economic security and cultural integration over the longer term. In contrast, officials from one advocacy and service organization, No One Left Behind, said they assisted local resettlement agencies with finding housing for SIV holders, and had established agreements with local resettlement agencies in some cities, including Rochester, New York and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to secure housing and provide furnishings for all SIV holder families they resettled. Officials we interviewed from all 9 national resettlement agencies and 12 of 13 local resettlement agencies reported that the legislature’s finding, as stated in the bill, was that SIV holders are “able to pursue their educational goals and rebuild and improve their lives and the lives of their families.” Upwardly Global officials describe their work as eliminating employment barriers for special immigrant visa (SIV) holders",
  " that USAO monitors and investigates chronic offenders to ultimately determine the appropriate enforcement actions, which may include settlement or other civil actions. In regards to the four active cases involving chronic offenders they reported to us in 2016, USAO officials noted that the agency is investigating one case, negotiating a resolution that will include a civil penalty in another case, and closing two other investigations without further action. In addition, USAO is reviewing its records to identify additional chronic offenders for further action due to noncompliance. We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for review and comment. The Department of Justice provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.

We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General, Secretary of the Senate, Clerk of the House, and interested congressional committees and members. We used the House lobbyists’ disclosure database as the source of the reports. We also used an electronic matching algorithm that allows for misspellings and other minor inconsistencies between the registrations and reports. Figure 2 shows lobbyists filed disclosure reports as required for most new lobbying registrations from 2010 through 2017. The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House review the guidance semiannually. It was last revised January 31, 2017, to (among other issues) update the registration threshold to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index, and clarify the identification of clients and covered officials and issues related to rounding income and expenses. The guidance provides definitions of LDA terms, elaborates on registration and reporting requirements, includes specific examples of different scenarios, and provides explanations of why certain scenarios prompt or do not prompt disclosure under the LDA. The offices of the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House told us they continue to consider information we report on lobbying disclosure compliance when they periodically update the guidance. In addition, they told us they e-mail registered lobbyists quarterly on common compliance issues and reminders to file reports by the due dates. The LDA defines a lobbyist as an individual who is employed or retained by a client for compensation, who has made more than one lobbying contact (written or oral communication to covered officials, such as a high ranking agency official or a Member of Congress made on behalf of a client), and whose lobbying activities have been reported to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for lobbying activities. The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for lobbying activities are required to report to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for lobbying activities. The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for lobbying activities are required to report to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for lobbying activities; the Secretary of the House for lobbying activities are required to report to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for lobbying activities; the Secretary of the House for lobbying activities are required to report to the Secretary of the Senate. LD-203 referrals are more complicated than LD-2 referrals because LD-2 referrals represent the lobbyists at the lobbying firm who have failed to file their registration with corresponding disclosure reports. Using an electronic matching algorithm that includes strict and loose text matching procedures, we identified matching disclosure reports for 2,995, or 87.2 percent, of the 3,433 newly filed registrations. We began by standardizing client and lobbyist names in both the report and registration files (including removing punctuation and standardizing words and abbreviations, such as “company” and “CO”). We then matched reports and registrations using the House identification number (which is linked to a unique lobbyist-client pair), as well as the names of the lobbyist and client. For reports we could not match by identification number and standardized name, we also attempted to match reports and registrations by client and lobbyist name, allowing for variations in the names to accommodate minor misspellings or typos. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The random sample of lobbying disclosure reports we selected was based on unique combination of House ID, lobbyist, and client names (see table 8). LD-203 referrals are more complicated than LD-2 referrals because LD-2 referrals represent the lobbyists at the lobbying firm who have failed",
  ". Without understanding the impact of its use of these flexibilities, neither FNS nor Congress knows whether these flexibilities are helping provide meals to children. In addition to the challenges with safety at meal sites, sponsors also sometimes face administrative challenges when participating in multiple child nutrition programs that are operated by different state agencies or divisions within the same agency. In this model, sponsors deliver meals by bus, using a route with state-approved stops in a community, and children consume the meal at the stop under a supervised setting. Although FNS and the majority of states do not collect data on nonfederal programs, results from our state survey and interviews with SFSP providers and organizations involved in summer meals indicate the reach of nonfederal programs is limited. In our survey, states reported that the geographic coverage of these nonfederal programs varied by state, with 11 states indicating that they operated in some portions of the state. In addition, 16 states reported that they had to fill out 60 additional pages of paperwork to provide summer meals to children in their state. In addition, 16 states reported that they were not aware of any nonfederal programs providing summer meals to children in their state. In addition, 16 states reported that they were not aware of any nonfederal programs providing summer meals to children in their state. In addition, 16 states reported that they were not aware of any nonfederal programs providing summer meals to children in their state. In addition, 16 states reported that they were not aware of any nonfederal programs providing summer meals to children in their state. In addition, 16 states reported that they were not aware of any nonfederal programs providing summer meals to children in their state (see fig. 4). According to our review of letters FNS sent to multiple states approving their requests for this type of flexibility, the agency identified a consistent set of circumstances that needed to be met for it to grant this flexibility. These circumstances were described in the letters the agency sent to states and generally included verification that violent crime activities occurred within both a 6-block radius of the meal site and 72 hours prior to the meal service. FNS’s letters to states indicate that when documentation was provided to the agency showing that these circumstances existed at a summer activity program for children and suggested that is one reason why organizations choose to participate in the SFSP. FNS’s letters to states indicate that these circumstances are not consistent with FNS’s requirements. FNS has issued guidance on the general processes for requesting flexibility from program requirements under its waiver and demonstration authorities, these guidance documents do not detail the specific circumstances that the agency considers when completing SFSP, such as the nutrition or meal pattern standards, such as the nutrition or meal pattern standards, as well as the administrative workload associated with the SFSP. Although the SFSP provides for federal reimbursement of eligible meals and certain administrative and operating costs, nonfederal programs that provide children with summer meals may choose not to participate in the SFSP for several reasons, according to officials we interviewed from several organizations involved in summer meals. For example, some nonfederal program providers may not participate in the SFSP because they do not have access to federal funding to provide summer meals to children. For example, some nonfederal programs, such as Cops N Kids in one selected state, or libraries in two selected states, provided meal services in combination with youth development or other enrichment activities. (See sidebar for highlights on the Cops N Kids program.) One national organization official said activities at SFSP sites can help take away the stigma around the program because children are not just there for the meal. Efforts to rebrand the SFSP as a community event where entire families can participate at the meal site also can have this effect, which is why some sponsors in the selected states said they partnered with foodbanks to donate meals for adults. In addition, a sponsor in one selected state told us they adjusted their meal offerings to match the needs of children of different age groups, for example, by serving meals to younger children earlier in the day and meals to teens later in the day. To support participation from children of all ages, FNS has shared information on age-appropriate activities through its SFSP toolkit and provided related grant funding. In addition, in 2010, school food authorities participating in the Seamless Summer Option added 643 and 298 summer meal sites, respectively, in the month with the largest number of SFSP meals served in each state (see fig. 3). In Arizona and Illinois, school food authorities participating in the Seamless Summer Option added 643 and 298 summer meal sites, respectively, in the month with the largest number of SFSP meals served, potentially leading to an underestimate. According to FNS officials, the agency instructs states to calculate ADA for July because officials identified this as the month with the largest number of meals served and assess change over time. To further examine what is known about participation in the SFSP, we also reviewed FNS’s data, we also reviewed FNS’",
  " other federal agencies to support implementation of their programs. It also includes funding provided to other federal agencies to support implementation of their programs. It also includes funding provided to other federal agencies to support implementation of their programs. It also includes funding provided to other federal, state, tribal, nongovernmental, and local entities to support implementation of their restoration-related projects in the Basin. Our prior reporting served as the conceptual framework for understanding the collaborative practices used by officials leading these case example efforts. We highlight in our report a single illustrative collaborative practice used for each effort. In addition, we separately emailed four questions to each of the 11 federal agencies with water quality-related restoration efforts. This includes funding through appropriations, matching funds, and cost- reimbursable activities for projects and studies implemented through its national programs and Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming- Montana regional Water Science Centers. This includes around $12 million in expenditures for National Water Quality Program activities, which provide an understanding of whether water quality conditions are improving or worsening over time, and how natural features and human activities affect those conditions. One of the efforts implemented through this program during this time frame was a regional study, the Pacific Northwest Stream Quality Assessment; USGS expenditures for this effort were about $3.3 million. The objectives of the regional study included determining the status of stream quality across the region by assessing various water quality factors that are stressors on aquatic life—such as contaminants, toxicity, and streamflow—and evaluating their relative influence on biological communities. EPA and OMB have not yet implemented actions required under Clean Water Act Section 123, which was enacted in 2016. According to officials, these factors make it difficult to establish mutually agreeable end-goals and means for restoration because various entities have potentially competing interests based on each organization’s primary mission. Specifically, prioritizing certain restoration efforts over others—as may occur through adoption of a basin-wide restoration strategy or plan—may lead some entities to not participate in basin-wide restoration activities. EPA and OMB have not yet implemented actions required under Clean Water Act Section 123, which was enacted in 2016. We recognize that crosscut budgets can help make data from multiple agencies more understandable and could be used to inform congressional oversight committees, participating agencies, and other entities implementing an ecosystem initiative. By directing each federal agency involved in the protection and restoration of the Columbia River Basin to collect the information needed for the interagency crosscut budget and to determine which projects and programs will be tracked across agencies, the process for developing an interagency crosscut budget, OMB has not yet implemented the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program, as directed by Clean Water Act Section 123. OMB has not yet prepared and submitted as part of the President’s annual budget request an interagency crosscut budget on federal agencies’ budgets for and spending on environmental protection and restoration efforts in the Basin. According to EPA officials we interviewed, the agency has not yet taken steps to establish the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program, including the Columbia River Basin Restoration Working Group, as directed by Clean Water Act Section 123. In the early to mid-1990s, the Columbia River Basin was identified as one of the primary sources of pollution in the Columbia River Basin. In the early to mid-1990s, the. Appendix II provides a list of the restoration efforts implemented in the Columbia River Basin from fiscal years 2010 through 2016, based on entities’ responses to our survey. See table 1 for examples of a range of restoration efforts implemented by various entities in the Basin from fiscal years 2010 through 2016. See table 1 for examples of a range of restoration efforts implemented by various entities in the Basin from fiscal years 2010 through 2016. Based on responses to our survey, we found that entities implemented restoration efforts in the Columbia River Basin for a variety of purposes, such as improving surface water quality or reducing toxic pollutants. Specifically, our survey listed five purposes and asked entities to identify whether each was a primary purpose, secondary purpose, or not a purpose of the respective restoration effort. Overall, the most common primary purposes identified were improving surface water quality and restoring and protecting habitat. For example, the Forest Service identified monitoring surface water quality as the sole purpose for its Pacific Northwest Region Aquatic Inventory and Monitoring effort, which inventories and monitors watershed and stream habitat conditions to provide information and feedback to improve resource protection and restoration programs. The program is implemented in partnership with the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, which makes recommendations on projects that should be funded and reviews the program at least every 5 years to develop updates as needed. BPA reported that from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, this is one of the largest fish and wildlife protection programs in the country, annually funding hundreds of projects implemented in the Columbia River Basin by a wide range of federal, state, local, tribal, academic, and nongovernmental entities across four states. The program is implemented in the Columbia River Basin, and stated that it agreed with the conclusions and recommendation in our report. The program is implemented in the Columbia River Basin. The program is one",
  " in nutrient credit trading, we also interviewed state and program officials and other stakeholders, such as point source and nonpoint source credit generators and buyers, to gather information on the programs, including structure, participants, number and type of trades, authorizing mechanisms, and outcomes. Specifically, to determine the number of trades we asked each state for its official list of trades from 2014, the most recent year for which we could get complete data from all programs. We counted each time a point source purchased credits as one trade. We interviewed officials from the institute that developed the program and corresponded with state officials from Kentucky and Ohio, two of the states involved in the Ohio Basin program. Finally, we interviewed representatives of stakeholder groups, such as those representing wastewater treatment facilities, national organizations for water issues, and agricultural conservation districts to get a broad perspective on the key factors that affect participation in nutrient credit trading programs. We also asked the states for the number of credits purchased and the aggregate discharge limit for point sources to determine the percentage of credits purchased and the percentage of credits to meet discharge limits. We also asked the states for the number of credits purchased and the aggregate discharge limit for point sources to determine the percentage of credits purchased in pounds of nutrients relative to the aggregate discharge limit. The aggregate discharge limit is the maximum allowable discharge for point sources in the program. Because this limit represents the maximum amount of pollution allowable to meet water quality standards, it served as a point of reference for comparing the amount of discharge that was traded. We took these numbers from state records. We identified 19 nutrient credit trading programs in 11 states and seven Environmental Protection Agency regions, in 2014. The 11 states that had programs are: California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia (see table 5). In addition, many TMDLs cover a single water body, such as a lake or a segment of a river. Unlike its approach for point sources, the Clean Water Act’s approach to curtailing nonpoint source pollution is largely voluntary. The Clean Water Act’s approach to curtailing nonpoint source pollution is largely voluntary. One of the primary ways that EPA addresses nonpoint source nutrient pollution is with the section 319 program. Through this grant-based program, EPA funds voluntary projects aimed at reducing nonpoint source pollution, particularly runoff from agricultural production. Grants from this program support a wide variety of activities including the development and implementation of best management practices (BMP), which are used to reduce or eliminate the introduction of pollutants into receiving waters. In addition, the state’s Department of Environmental Protection conducts periodic inspections of point sources to ensure that point sources did not have to meet nutrient discharge limits. Once EPA established the TMDL for the Chesapeake Bay—and Pennsylvania established discharge limits for point sources in the NPDES permit discharge limits, they could buy credits to meet discharge limits. In Pennsylvania, 29 percent of point sources in 2014. We provided a draft of this report to EPA for review and comment. In addition, we are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, a nonpoint source that seeks to reduce nutrient pollution, and information about steps the nonpoint source will take to reduce or eliminate the introduction of pollutants into receiving waters. For example, the state’s Department of Environmental Protection conducts periodic inspections of point sources to ensure that they are Officials in Virginia said that in the first years of the program, little trading took place because point sources did not have to meet nutrient discharge limits. Once EPA established the TMDL for the Chesapeake Bay—and Pennsylvania established discharge limits for point sources in the NPDES permits—demand for nutrient credit trading increased, according to Pennsylvania officials. Officials explained that if point sources had not yet upgraded their nutrient removal technology, and could not meet the NPDES permit discharge limits, they could buy nutrient credits to comply with discharge limits. EPA officials added that demand for trading could increase over the long term because of economic or population growth. In addition to programs in the three states, we also reviewed a program in the Ohio River Basin where nutrient credit trading activity has been limited, according to program officials. This multi-state trading program allows point and nonpoint sources in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky to generate and sell nutrient credits, and was designed as a pilot to test nutrient credit trading in case discharge limits were established. According to Connecticut’s 2014/2015 program report, the number of point sources that bought credits in 2014 was due to (1) increased discharges from three large wastewater treatment facilities that were under construction that year and (2) cold weather that affected the ability of point sources to remove nutrients from their discharges using biological processes. For comparison, 35 percent of point sources bought credits in 2015. A member of the Nutrient Credit Exchange Advisory Board in Connecticut told us that since the program began in 2002, the number of point sources that have needed to buy credits has generally decreased over time as these facilities have upgraded their requirements",
  "OPs when recording, tracking, and resolving findings discovered during Cuban airport assessments, TSA inspectors found that most of the airports were fully compliant with all but one or two of the ICAO standards and recommended practices. However, air carriers operating at Cuban airports have been unable to designate their own GSCs to review security matters for U.S.-bound flights for two reasons. First, the Government of Cuba controls most sectors of the economy and employs the majority of the Cuban workforce. As a result, according to an airline official we spoke with, there are no private security firms or trained GSCs in Cuba that air carriers can contract with to serve as their authorized representatives and review security matters for each U.S.-bound flight at Cuban airports. Second, TSA officials told us that the Government of Cuba employs Aviation Security Technicians (AST) to review security matters for each U.S.-bound flight at Cuban airports. According to these officials, ASTs undergo a training regimen similar to that of a GSC and can execute GSC roles and responsibilities. As a result, the Government of Cuba has not allowed air carriers to permanently station air carrier-employed GSCs at Cuban airports because, according to TSA officials, it believes ASTs already provide for these roles and responsibilities. As part of the report, and as shown in table 1, it generally takes 3 to 7 days to complete a foreign airport assessment. However, the amount of time and number of team members required to conduct an assessment varies based on several factors, including the size of the airport and the threat level to civil aviation in the host country. At the close of an airport assessment, inspectors brief foreign airport and government officials on the results as well as any recommendations for corrective actions and prepare an internal report. As part of the report, and as shown in table 1, TSA documentation of each finding and documentation on TSA’s findings response, follow-up, and closure, including air carrier inspection reports and enforcement investigative reports. To determine whether TSA performed Cuban airport assessments and air carrier inspections at the frequency established in TSA’s SOPs, we analyzed TSA data for all airport assessments from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. We also analyzed TSA air carrier inspection data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 for a non-probability sample of 5 of the 18 air carriers operating U.S.-bound flights from Cuba that TSA inspected during this period along with flight traffic data for Cuba. TSA assigns a vulnerability score to each ICAO standard and recommended practice assessed as well as an overall vulnerability score for each airport, which corresponds to the level of compliance for each ICAO standard and recommended practice that TSA assesses. If the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that an airport does not maintain and carry out effective security measures, he or she shall, after advising the Secretary of State, take secretarial action. This generally includes notification to the appropriate authorities of security deficiencies identified, notification to the general public that the airport does not maintain effective security measures, publication of the identity of the airport in the Federal Register, and, when appropriate, modification of air carriers operations at that airport. According to TSA officials, no secretarial actions have been issued for We also found that data in air carrier inspection reports were generally complete and error-free. However, TSA was unable to provide full documentation for some of the air carrier inspections it conducted in Cuba in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. TSA officials attributed these missing documents to human error. We also identified errors or missing data fields in most of the air carrier inspections reports with complete documentation. TSA deemed some of the comparison results related to this objective to be sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure. This public report also omits certain information that TSA deemed to be sensitive related to the specific number of airport assessments and air carrier inspections performed by TSA in Cuba, results of those assessments and inspections, and TSA’s risk-based approach in identifying U.S.-bound public charter operations from Cuba. We are making the following recommendation to TSA: The Administrator of TSA should instruct the Office of Global Strategies to improve TSA’s ability to identify all public charter operations requiring inspection in Cuba and develop and implement a tool that corroborates and validates flight schedule data to more reliably track air carriers’ public charter operations between the United States and Cuba. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of our report to DHS for its review and comment. In June 2018, DHS provided written comments, which are noted below and reproduced in full in appendix II. DHS and the Department of Transportation provided technical comments in the prior sensitive report, which we also incorporated as appropriate in this report. DHS attributed these to human error and has since issued guidance and updated its air carrier inspection report template designed to better ensure that air carrier inspections in Cuba and other foreign locations at the start of each fiscal year. According to TSA officials, TSA inspectors develop the Master Work Plan by collecting flight schedule data from Cuba, results of those assessments and inspections, and TSA’s risk-based approach in identifying U.

  "’s regional teams are led by EPA’s Region 10 and a co-chair that rotates among the other agencies. The federal task force consists of a national-level leadership group—which focuses on higher-level policy, oversight, and coordination issues—and regional leadership and implementation teams that perform much of the on-the-ground implementation and coordination work of the task force. The participant explained that this agreement has helped the local governments look beyond their immediate jurisdictions and think more broadly about priorities for the entire watershed. We have previously reported that agencies that articulate their agreements in formal documents can strengthen their commitment to working collaboratively. Federal and nonfederal entities we surveyed and interviewed identified benefits produced by the steps taken to coordinate restoration efforts, including the development of the management conference, the federal task force, and their respective planning documents. As a result of these limitations, we limited our collection of expenditure data to a nongeneralizable sample of three federal programs and one state program to provide examples of the diversity in funding approaches used to support Puget Sound restoration. We found that federal and nonfederal entities consistently identified certain key factors as posing significant risks to the long-term overall success of Puget Sound restoration efforts. In addition, federal and nonfederal entities consistently identified certain key factors as posing significant risks to the long-term overall success of Puget Sound restoration efforts. In particular, the Partnership has reported that federal and nonfederal entities have identified certain key factors as posing significant risks to the long-term overall success of Puget Sound restoration efforts. Through their responses to the first phase of our survey, officials from federal and state entities identified numerous environmental stressors that threaten Puget Sound and that have impaired water quality. In particular, the Partnership has reported that nonpoint sources of pollution, such as polluted stormwater runoff from roads and agricultural fields, are the biggest threats to Puget Sound water quality. To examine the framework for assessing progress toward Puget Sound restoration, we reviewed laws, regulations, and key documents, such as the CCMP and the draft Federal Action Plan. We also reviewed the Partnership’s documentation on the results of its assessments of restoration efforts. We identified some limitations associated with these results and noted those in our report where appropriate. Through their responses to the first phase of our survey, officials from federal and state entities identified numerous efforts that supported Puget Sound restoration from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Specifically, respondents from federal entities identified 73 federal efforts, and respondents from state entities identified 80 state efforts that, in whole or in part, supported Puget Sound restoration during this period. The federal task force has limited ability to assess how the implementation of the CCMP’s goals, vital signs, indicators, or recovery targets.

The federal task force has limited ability to assess how the implementation of the CCMP’s goals, vital signs, indicators, or recovery targets. The federal task force has limited ability to assess how the implementation of the CCMP’s goals Federal and nonfederal entities have made progress in coordinating the numerous restoration efforts underway by establishing the Puget Sound Management Conference and the Puget Sound Federal Task Force and by developing the CCMP and the draft Federal Action Plan. The Partnership uses information from the Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program and other sources to assess and report on restoration progress in a biennial State of the Sound report, which was most recently published in November 2017. The Partnership has assessed two primary aspects of restoration progress for the CCMP’s 47 indicators: (1) progress relative to baseline conditions and (2) progress toward the 2020 recovery targets. The 2017 State of the Sound reported the general results of assessments of progress relative to baseline conditions for 29 of the 47 indicators, with additional details available on the Partnership’s website. According to the Partnership’s website, progress was made in some areas but many key indicators did not show improvement, as reflected below: Ten indicators improved compared to baseline data. For example, the National Estuary Program funds have been leveraged to obtain significant nonfederal funding support for Puget Sound restoration efforts. For example, the Floodplains by Design program, a joint effort led by The Nature Conservancy and state agencies to restore natural floodplain functions, has used National Estuary Program funds to help leverage nonfederal funding support, according to the EPA officials. NOAA’s Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. Under this program, NOAA awards funds through grants to state and tribal entities to carry out salmon recovery activities in five western states. In Washington State, NOAA provided funds to the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office and the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission for use in Puget Sound restoration efforts and their views on this coordination; (3)",
  " or more. NASA can support no more than one mission using RPS about every 4 years—or two to three missions per decade—based on expected agency funding levels. Cost of RPS relative to mission costs. According to NASA officials, New Frontiers missions may be good candidates to use RPS; however, given the cost cap for this mission class, one RPS would account for about 9 percent of the mission’s budget, while three RPS would account for almost 14 percent. For Discovery missions, for which the cost of using RPS would represent a large portion of a Discovery mission budget, a single RPS would represent more than 17 percent of a mission’s development cap. DOE’s production capability. According to DOE officials we interviewed, it can take up to 6 years to acquire, fuel, test, and deliver a new RPS for a NASA mission. According to DOE and NASA officials we interviewed, given the current floor space dedicated to RPS development at INL and limits on staff exposure to radiation at LANL, DOE only has the capacity to produce three to four RPS at one time. To accommodate DOE’s current RPS production capability, NASA officials we interviewed said they will not select two consecutive missions requiring RPS. Technological advances may reduce the demand for Pu-238 and deliver a new RPS for a NASA mission.

Technological advances may reduce the demand for Pu-238 and thus RPS. For example, according to NASA officials, advances in solar power technology have realistically expanded the ability to use solar power for missions for which it would not have been considered before, and these advances could help address low levels of light intensity for deep space missions. NASA also is developing new RPS technologies that may reduce its demand for Pu-238 and thus RPS. NASA also is developing new RPS technologies that may reduce its demand for Pu-238 and thus RPS. New Frontiers. New Frontiers missions focus on enhancing our understanding of the solar system and have a development cost cap of $850 million. To date, there has been one New Frontiers mission using RPS (New Horizons). Discovery. Missions in the Discovery program have a development cost cap of $450 million to $500 DOE officials said HFIR can produce approximately 600 grams of Pu-238 isotope and they plan to use positions within ATR to achieve full production goals; however, ATR has not been qualified for Supply Project work. In addition, DOE officials said that ATR’s availability for the Supply Project may be limited due to competition from other users. DOE officials said that ATR’s availability for the Supply Project may be limited due to competition from other users. DOE officials said that they will be unable to meet full Pu-238 production goals if positions in ATR, which are already over-utilized, are not available for Pu-238 isotope production and that they do not have a plan to address this challenge. These and other challenges identified in our September 2017 report may place DOE’s RPS and Pu-238 production goals at risk, in part, because of the short-term and incremental segmented management approach DOE had used to manage the Supply Project since its inception in 2011 through early 2017. In March 2017, DOE officials we interviewed said that the agency anticipated moving to a constant GPHS production rate approach to help provide funding flexibility and stabilize RPS production staffing levels between NASA missions. In June 2017, DOE officials we interviewed said that implementing a constant GPHS production rate approach would also address other previously identified challenges associated with RPS production and the Supply Project and therefore decided to discontinue its short-term and incremental segmented management approach. However, DOE officials we interviewed said that the agency anticipated moving to a constant GPHS production rate approach to help provide funding flexibility and stabilize RPS production staffing levels between NASA missions.

  " officials told us that they had established their own print device procurement sources primarily because they believed that these sources are less expensive than using DLA Document Services. This is primarily because DLA Document Services charges administrative and overhead costs to support its operations, such as facility and maintenance costs, whereas the services’ own contracts do not require any additional fees, according to these officials. However, service officials were unable to provide any analyses or other documentation to support these determinations, and some service officials have been reassessing their approach to obtaining devices. Navy and Marine Corps: The Department of the Navy established guidance in 2013, directing Department of the Navy officials to work with DLA Document Services to adjust the size and composition of its workforce by the plan’s completion in fiscal year 2019. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. DLA Document Services intends to reduce its total number of full-time equivalent positions from about 600 to about 400, mainly through Voluntary Early Retirement Agreements and Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments. According to officials, DLA Document Services recommended further reductions in the number of print devices across the Navy and Marine Corps, which it estimated could save over $63 million annually. However, the Marine Corps official responsible for implementing the Department of the Navy officials to develop policy requiring that the acquisition of new devices be exclusively through DLA Document Services. DLA subsequently conducted these assessments and found that the Navy and Marine Corps had an average of one device for every seven users. DLA Document Services recommended further reductions in the number of print devices across the Navy and Marine Corps, which it estimated could save over $63 million annually. For our first objective, we reviewed DOD documents and interviewed DOD officials in order to understand how each military service obtains document services and identify department-wide and military service efficiency initiatives for these services. DLA Document Services subsequently conducted these assessments and found that the Navy and Marine Corps had an average of one device for every seven users. DLA Document Services recommended further reductions in the number of print devices across the Navy and Marine Corps, which it estimated could save over $63 million annually. However, Department of the Navy officials were unable to provide us with data on the total number of print devices and associated services (see fig. 5). However, we were unable to determine which sources provided the greatest value, because DLA Document Services intends to transition customers to using an online portal to fulfill their printing needs. According to DLA, it is hiring many of the customer relations specialists from current DLA Document Services locations, and the planned reduction in its total full-time equivalent positions is a net reduction that accounts for the hiring of, and conversion of existing positions to, these customer relations specialists. DLA Document Services also plans to use and expand its existing public and private sector partnerships to support an increased emphasis on online services as it implements its transformation plan. For example, DLA Document Services intends to transition customers to using an online portal for fulfilling printing and reproduction services in cooperation with FedEx Office. For those customer orders that DLA Document Services provides administrative support, such as centralized billing and record keeping, that the military services would have to replicate in their absence. These officials also stated that they were unaware of any persistent problems with the quality or timeliness of DLA Document Services’ work, and that they work with customers to resolve such issues when they arise. According to officials, DOD is in the process of revising DOD Instruction 5330.03, and a draft of the revision continues to assign DLA as the single manager for printing and reproduction services within DOD. However, despite the concerns expressed by some military service officials, DOD has not assessed the extent to which DLA Document Services is fulfilling its duties in accordance with DOD Instruction 5330.03 when considering any revisions to the instruction. Additionally, DOD has not assessed whether the products and services DLA Document Services provides are based on “best value,” as determined by quality, price, and delivery time, in accordance with the instruction. DLA began conducting these assessments for the Navy and Marine Corps in fiscal year 2014. According to DLA Document Services, in fiscal year 2017, it received in revenue about $108 million for print device procurement and about $105 million for printing and reproduction services. According to DLA Document Services officials, the Office of Acquisition and Sustainment has had minimal involvement in ensuring that DLA Document Services is fulfilling its duties in accordance with the instruction.

  "We found that CBP and ICE are aware of the risks associated with counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods may also lack key elements of certification markings and other identifiers. For example, on a counterfeit phone charger we purchased, the UL certification mark did not include all components of the authentic mark. Figure 1 shows examples of these counterfeit items. Figure 1 shows examples of these counterfeit items. The risks associated with the types of counterfeit goods we purchased can extend beyond the infringement of a company’s IPR. For example, a UL investigation of counterfeit iPhone adapters found a 99 percent failure rate in 400 counterfeit adapters tested for safety, fire, and shock hazards and found that 12 of the adapters tested posed a risk of lethal electrocution to the user. Similarly, according to a rights holder representative, counterfeits of common consumer goods, such as Yeti travel mugs, may contain higher-than-approved concentrations of dangerous chemicals such as lead, posing health risks to consumers. According to ICE, seized counterfeit cosmetics have been found to contain hazardous substances, including cyanide, arsenic, mercury, lead, urine, and rat droppings. Representatives of rights holders and e-commerce websites whom we interviewed reported taking independent action to try to protect IPR within their areas of responsibility. For example, both rights holders and e- commerce websites maintain IPR protection teams that work with law enforcement to identify and remove counterfeit goods such as lead, posing health risks to consumers. According to ICE, seized counterfeit cosmetics have been found to contain hazardous substances, including cyanide, arsenic, mercury, lead, urine, and rat droppings. Representatives of rights holders and e-commerce websites whom we interviewed reported taking independent action to try to protect IPR within their areas of responsibility. For example, both rights holders and e- commerce websites maintain IPR protection teams that work with law enforcement to identify and remove counterfeit goods from the marketplace. However, according to CBP officials, there are legal limitations to the amount and type of information they can share, particularly if the e-commerce website is not listed as the importer on forms submitted to CBP. Several private sector representatives stated that receiving additional information from CBP would enhance their ability to protect IPR. When selling online, counterfeiters may post pictures of authentic goods on the websites where they are selling counterfeits and may post pseudonymous reviews of their products or businesses in order to appear legitimate. Additionally, by setting the price of a counterfeit at, or close to, the retail price of a genuine good, counterfeiters may deceive consumers, who will pay the higher price because they believe the goods are real or who believe that they are getting a slight bargain on genuine goods. According to CBP seizure data and CBP officials, the volume, variety, and methods of shipment of counterfeit goods seized by CBP and ICE have changed in recent years. These steps include, for example, buying only from authorized retailers online, avoiding prices that look “too good to be true,” and reporting",

Fintech firms may be subject to CFPB oversight and limited federal financial regulatory oversight if they also partner with financial institutions. In addition, some fintech firms have applied for a CFPB No Action Letter, which is intended to reduce regulatory uncertainty for financial products or services that promise substantial consumer benefit but This group also functions as an interagency collaboration mechanism through biennial meetings between industry stakeholders and relevant regulators that update industry on regulatory concerns, identify potential regulatory gaps, and educate regulators on mobile payment technologies. In general, these risks are similar to those posed by traditional financial products. While laws that apply to traditional products also apply to fintech firms may be subject to regulatory oversight of their compliance with applicable consumer or other laws. For example, some fintech firms may be subject to regulatory oversight of their compliance with applicable consumer or other laws. Fintech firms can find that the complexity of the U.S. financial regulatory system creates challenges in identifying the laws and regulations that apply to their activities, and that complying with state licensing and reporting requirements can be expensive and time-consuming for mobile payment providers and fintech lenders. Fintech firms may be subject to regulatory oversight. Fintech firms have concluded research pilots with CFPB and three other firms are currently participating in pilots. Similarly, FCC staff could not recall why they had not participated in recent biennial regulator meetings of the Mobile Payments Industry Workgroup. The financial regulators have recently begun to hold collaborative information sharing discussions on consumer compliance issues surrounding financial account aggregation, but this collaboration has not resulted in any coordinated public outcomes on the issues. In May 2017, the federal financial regulators—CFPB, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC—and representatives of state financial regulators began to share information on account aggregation and related consumer compliance issues through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Task Force on Supervision and the FFIEC Task Force on Consumer Compliance.

It also consists of validating requirements as the system is being developed to ensure that the final systems to be deployed will perform as intended in an operational environment. Risk management: Risk management is a process for anticipating problems and developing plans to take appropriate steps to mitigate risks and minimize their impact on program commitments. It involves identifying and documenting risks, categorizing them based on their estimated impact, prioritizing them, developing risk mitigation strategies, and tracking progress in executing the strategies. According to GAO’s Information Technology Investment Management guide, leading practices for managing IT projects include: instituting the investment board, which is the process for creating and defining the membership, guiding policies, operations, roles, responsibilities, and authorities within the organization; providing oversight whereby the organization monitors each project on its performance progress (e.g., establishing and tracking baseline estimates on cost and schedule goals, and thresholds to identify high risk on cost and schedule); and capturing and providing performance information about a particular investment (project) to decision makers at regular intervals (e.g., quarterly and annually). In addition, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the program provided consistent criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and severity levels. Specifically, the program provided a risk exposure (e.g., a risk source used to examine and oversee changes that impact the project), which is the value that is given to a risk event, a product, or the overall program based on the analysis of the probability and consequences of the event. Further, the program’s Risk Management Guide outlined risk performance, cost, and schedule criteria. In addition, the program demonstrated that it included the cost and benefits of implementing risk mitigation plans. Specifically, a risk’s description provided the cost and benefits of implementing risk mitigation plans. Specifically, a risk’s description provided the cost and benefits of implementing risk mitigation plans. Specifically, a risk’s description provided the cost impacts associated with the risk, which in turn provided evidence that cost and benefits were considered during risk evaluation. However, the Navy partially implemented one practice. Specifically, although the program provided its failover/recovery plan that is intended to return the program to a state of readiness after a failure, the plan did not explicitly identify environmental elements. A program official stated that environmental factors, such as risks that could negatively affect their work, is understood, but these factors had not been documented in the plan. Further, the former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics announced that non-business MAIS programs would adhere to DOD’s Instruction 5000.02 policy for management and oversight. Further, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering to be responsible for driving innovation and acceleration of the department’s business operations. In January 2015, DOD updated its guidelines ’s Joint Space Operations Center Mission System Increment 2 program attributed its schedule slippage of 2 years and 11 months to funding reductions of $18.9 million in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. In addition, the officials noted that an aggressive schedule for a Milestone B decision, contracting issues in the earlier acquisition phase, and longer than expected time to obtain personnel had contributed to the slippage. Longer than expected time to reach deployment. Officials for the Air Force’s Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System Increment 1 program reported that its schedule slippage of 5 years occurred because of a change in the approach to deliver the system in multiple increments, thereby increasing the amount of time it would take to reach the deployment decision milestone. Also, officials for the Defense Information Systems Agency’s Teleport Generation 3 program reported a 3-year and 2-month slip. This schedule delay was due to the program’s inability to develop the mobile user and system interface capability by the estimated deployment milestone. Further, program officials for the Navy’s Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services program attributed its schedule slip of 2 years and 6 months to a longer than expected maintenance period for the test platform and to a lengthy budget approval process, resulting in a slippage in the deployment date.

  "-foot coastal buoy tenders are past the point in their service lives when a midlife maintenance availability would normally have been conducted. In July 2018, we found that that the Coast Guard has historically operated vessels well past their expected end of service life, and it will likely need to do so with these assets given limited available acquisition funding. The Coast Guard has a management body—the Executive Oversight Council—in place to conduct oversight of its major acquisition programs; however, this management body has not conducted oversight across the entire acquisition portfolio using a comprehensive, collective approach. Among the Coast Guard’s three cross-directorate groups that have roles in the acquisition process, we found in July 2018 that the Executive Oversight Council is best positioned to oversee the portfolio collectively and has the potential to implement key portfolio-wide management practices, including conducting formal reviews and issuing reports. This council has cross-directorate senior-level management representation, access to information on acquisition programs, and support from the other two cross-directorate groups (the Systems Integration Team and the Resource Councils). However, this council has not carried out these portfolio-wide practices. In 2014, the Coast Guard updated the Executive Oversight Council’s charter, in response to our September 2012 recommendation, adding the responsibility for portfolio-wide oversight to include conducting formal reviews and issuing reports.

In 2014, the Coast Guard updated the Executive Oversight Council’s charter, in response to our September 2012 recommendation, adding the responsibility for portfolio-wide oversight to include conducting an annual review to assess and oversee acquisitions collectively. However, in our July 2018 review, we found that the Coast Guard has, since 2012, prepared a 5- year CIP that it is required to update and submit annually with the administration’s budget request. The 5-year CIP is the Coast Guard’s key acquisition portfolio planning tool. However, in our July 2018 review, we found that shortcomings of that plan that limit its effectiveness. Specifically, we found that the Coast Guard’s 5-year CIPs continue to demonstrate a pattern of certain ineffective planning practices, such as not identifying priorities or trade-offs between acquisition programs and not providing information about the effect of current decisions on the overall affordability of the acquisition The Polar Star is expected to reach the end of its service life between 2020 and 2023. The Polar Star is expected to reach the end of its service life between 2020 and 2023 while the first heavy polar icebreaker is expected to be delivered in fiscal year 2023, with the second and third icebreakers expected to be delivered in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Figure 1 shows the potential icebreaking capability gap. Figure 1 shows the potential icebreaking capability gap. We are currently conducting a review of the heavy polar icebreaker acquisition, and, preliminarily, we have found that the Coast Guard set an optimistic schedule baseline for the delivery dates for new polar icebreakers based on the ice-breaking capability gap rather than an analysis of what is realistic and feasible. Rather than building a schedule based on knowledge—such as determining realistic schedule targets and analyzing how much time to include in the schedule to buffer against potential delays, and comprehensively assessing schedule risks—the Coast Guard used the estimated end date of the Polar Star’s service life as the primary driver to set the lead icebreaker’s objective (or target) delivery date of September 2023 and threshold (latest acceptable) delivery date of March 2024. Design study information provided by several shipbuilders estimated that it could take up to 3.5 years to build the Polar Star, but the Coast Guard is planning for a more optimistic estimate of 2.5 years for the delivery date.

IHS officials also told us they provide access to 19 parking spaces for camping vehicles. Rosebud Hospital. Officials from Rosebud Hospital stated they provide 150 housing units and are also constructing a 19-unit hotel- style building. They said that most, if not all, candidates from outside of the area ask about housing unit availability when deciding whether to accept a position. Pine Ridge Hospital. Officials from Pine Ridge Hospital told us that IHS also provides 105 housing units for its employees. According to officials, recent graduates from residency programs applying for permanent positions with the Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility often cite prior rotations at the service unit, or word of mouth from students or residents who have rotated through the service unit, as a reason for applying.

IHS officials said they have conducted webinars and career fairs in an attempt to connect with health professional students. For example, in 2016, IHS conducted two informational webinars to recruit Commissioned Corps applicants to facilities in the Great Plains area with critical clinical vacancies. According to IHS officials, after conducting a needs assessment in 2016, they determined the unmet need for housing at IHS facilities was 1,100 units. According to IHS officials, the unmet need for housing at IHS facilities was 1,100 units. According to these officials, the needs assessment also helped them identify some of the greatest needs for housing. The President’s fiscal year 2017 budget proposal for IHS requested $12 million to build new staff housing units “in isolated and In addition to these agency-wide telehealth programs, IHS officials identified multiple other local telehealth arrangements that facility staff have developed to help maintain patient access to medical services. For example, there is a diabetes consultant for the Portland area who conducts telenutrition services. There is also a teledermatology program for the Phoenix Area federal facilities operated out of the Phoenix Indian Medical Center. Additionally, several service units—including Pine Ridge Hospital, Rosebud Hospital, and the Sioux San Medical Center—have contracts for temporary providers, which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards regarding the availability of health care providers. In addition, the Sioux San Medical Center and the Sioux San Medical Center have contracts for up to $20,000 per year in loan repayment funding and up to an additional $5,000 per year to offset tax liability, which IHS pays directly to the Internal Revenue Service. Loan repayment recipients can extend their initial two-year contract on an annual basis until their original approved educational loan debt is paid. In fiscal year 2017, a total of 1,267 providers—about 8 percent of the federal IHS workforce—were receiving IHS loan repayments. This included 434 new two-year contracts, 396 one-year extension contracts, and 437 providers starting the second year of their fiscal year 2016 two-year contract.

After 1999, CSPF’s investment policy under other, successive named fiduciaries continued to be broad and generally specified that the plan should invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities. Specifically J.P. Morgan’s and Northern Trust’s consecutive investment policies for part of the plan’s assets continued to specify that a majority of the plan’s assets be invested in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 15 percent be invested in nonpublicly traded assets. CSPF’s investment policy under other, successive named fiduciaries continued to be broad and generally specified that the plan should invest a majority of assets in equity or equity-type securities and no more than 15 percent be invested in nonpublicly traded assets. We provided a draft of the report to the U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for review and comment.

We received technical comments from the U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for review and comment. CSPF trustees said that named fiduciaries considered investing in alternative assets, but instead chose to increase the plan’s allocation to equity assets. We also ran another calculation that did not include “other” income so we could estimate the impact of not adjusting for such information. The U.S. Department of the Treasury provided no comments. We will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and other interested parties. This report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. In 2015, the plan’s actuary certified that the plan was in “critical and declining” status. Multiemployer plan trust funds can be allocated among many different types of assets, any of which can generally be passively- or actively-managed, domestically or internationally based, or publicly or nonpublicly traded (see table 1). A plan’s funded percentage is its ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities. We calculated the dollar-weighted average return, calculated as a geometric average of the annual returns over the period. The dollar-weighted average return is the rate that, when applied over time to a variety of economic and demographic factors, including the potential volatility of asset values, estimates of a plan’s funded percentage may vary from year to year. Defined benefit pension plans Treasury, specifically the IRS, is charged with determining whether a private sector pension plan qualifies for preferential tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the IRS is generally responsible for enforcing ERISA’s minimum funding requirements, among other things. The consent decree defines roles and responsibilities for its parties, including the court, the court-appointed independent special counsel, DOL, the plan and its Board of Trustees, and the independent asset manager, which is called the named fiduciary. The primary role of the court is to oversee and enforce the consent decree. Specifically, to ensure we captured the vast majority of the assets in CSPF and the plan’s demographics—such as an older population and fewer employers—in its decision to withdraw. CSPF officials said they did not want UPS to withdraw because its annual contributions accounted for about one-third of all contributions to the plan. CSPF officials also told us that, prior to the UPS withdrawal, they had expected the population of active UPS workers in CSPF to grow over time. In our prior work, we reported that multiemployer plans generally develop an assumed average rate of investment return and use that assumption to determine funding targets, required contributions, and the potential cost of benefit improvements. We did not identify an alternative asset category in CSPF’s asset reports for 2016, but the TUCS comparator group median asset allocation in that year is 11.8 percent of assets. Similar to our findings when comparing the returns on CSPF’s investments to a customized peer group of other large institutional funds, the annual returns on CSPF’s investments in recent decades have also generally been in line with the annual returns of similar multiemployer pension plans.

  " level for the LCR. EPA has efforts underway to reconsider the action level for the LCR. EPA has efforts underway to reconsider the action level for the LCR, which may include a change in the action level from one that is based on technical feasibility, to one that also considers lead exposure in vulnerable populations such as infants and young children, which EPA refers to as a health-based benchmark. In 1988, the SDWA was amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCCA), which banned the manufacture and sale of drinking water coolers with lead-lined tanks containing more than 8 percent lead; the statute defined a drinking water cooler as containing 8 percent lead or less as “lead-free.” The LCCA also required states to establish testing and remediation programs for schools. The LCCA also required states to establish testing and remediation programs for schools. However, in 1996 a federal circuit court held that this requirement was unconstitutional. In 2011, Congress passed the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, which amended the SDWA by lowering the maximum allowable lead content in “lead-free” plumbing materials such as pipes. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead in school drinking water. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program to support school district efforts to test for and remediation of lead in school drinking water. This provision became effective on January 4, 2014. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act which, among other things, amended the SDWA, to establish a grant program for states to assist school districts in voluntary testing for lead contamination in drinking water at schools. We interviewed representatives with the University of Massachusetts, because of their role in implementing the state’s program to support school district efforts to test for and remediate lead in school drinking water. As a condition of receiving funds, school districts are required to test for lead using standards that are at least as stringent as those in federal guidance for schools. In March 2018, Congress appropriated $20 million to EPA for this grant program. Lead can enter drinking water when service lines or plumbing fixtures that contain lead corrode, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content. According to EPA, responsibility for water management may be held by individuals in different positions, such as facilities managers or environmental specialists. Lead is a neurotoxin that can accumulate in the body over time with long- lasting effects, particularly for children. According to the CDC, lead in school drinking water during the past 12 months varied substantially, depending on the number of schools in which a district took action to remediate lead (see table 3). The median expenditure for school districts taking action in one to four schools was $4,000 compared to a median expenditure for school districts taking action in 51 or more schools of $278,000. EPA regional officials provided examples of eight states that have requirements for schools to test for lead in school drinking water as EPA has made further efforts to communicate the importance of lead testing to schools to help ensure that their lead testing programs are in line with good practices included in the 3Ts guidance. EPA has made further efforts to communicate the importance of lead testing to schools to help ensure that their lead testing programs are in line with good practices included in the 3Ts guidance. We also evaluated federal efforts against the Memorandum of Understanding, in which EPA, Education, and CDC agreed to encourage testing drinking water for lead and communicate with key stakeholders, among other things. To inform all of our research objectives, we interviewed representatives with the National Conference of State Legislatures, National Center for Healthy Housing, National Alliance of Public Charter Schools, the DC Public Charter School Board, and the 21st Century School Fund. We identified a range of approaches to communicating testing efforts in the 17 school districts we interviewed. Some school districts reported issuing press releases, putting letters in multiple languages in students’ backpacks, sending emails to parents, holding public meetings, and releasing information through social media. Although the guidance recommends that school districts prioritize taking action if lead levels from water fountains and other outlets used for consumption exceed 20 ppb (based on a 250 milliliter water sample), EPA officials told us when the guidance was originally developed in response to the 1988 LCCA requirement, the agency did not have information available to recommend an action level specifically designed for schools. Furthermore, EPA officials told us that the action level in the 3Ts guidance is not a health-based standard. However, there are statements in the guidance that appear to suggest otherwise. For a more detailed discussion of our survey methodology, see appendix I. The survey was comprised of closed- and open-ended questions. In this appendix, we",

The Air Force established a dedicated team to identify and develop initiatives specifically to address its reported fighter pilot shortage, and this effort has resulted in over 35 implemented initiatives. The Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (Resources), along with Major Command manpower staffs establish staffing standards and, at a minimum, by policy are to reevaluate these standards for applicability and updates every 2 years, or earlier if dictated by significant workload or mission changes. The Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency determines staffing resource requirements and provides staffing and management consultation services to Air Force functional communities for improved resource utilization and enhanced mission effectiveness and efficiency.

In November 2017 testimony, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps leaders reported that fighter pilots do not meet military service flight hour targets—in part due to reduced aircraft availability. For example, Navy and Marine Corps leaders testified that Navy and Marine Corps should ensure that the Chief of Naval Operations reevaluate fighter pilot squadron requirements, to include updating current assumptions of fighter pilot workload, and assessing the impact of future incorporation of UAS platforms into combat aviation. (Recommendation 2) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Deputy Commandant for Aviation reevaluate fighter pilot squadron requirements. In June 2017 we reported on readiness challenges in Air Force and Marine Corps aviation squadrons. The military services have trained fewer fighter pilots than targeted over the last decade. In fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the Air Force trained 12 percent fewer new fighter pilots than the targeted amount, while the Navy and Marine Corps each trained 8 percent fewer new fighter pilots than the targeted amount. In addition, Marine Corps data showed that the Marine Corps was unable to fully staff fighter pilots in fiscal years 2007 through 2016. In fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the Air Force trained 12 percent fewer new fighter pilots than the targeted amount.

HHS-OIG has the authority to exclude entities that have committed certain acts from participation in federal health care programs. According to HHS-OIG officials said that the agency transitioned away from other agreement types because of certain limitations that made them less useful than CIAs and IAs. For example, one historical agreement type— Certification of Compliance Agreements—did not provide sufficient opportunities for oversight, yet it required significant resources to create, officials said. Another discontinued agreement type—Settlement Agreement with Integrity Provisions—was negotiated as part of the DOJ settlement, such that HHS-OIG needed to work through DOJ if there was a need to take action for noncompliance. Although HHS-OIG and DOJ negotiate their agreements and settlements separately now, the majority of CIAs and IAs, are still associated with a DOJ legal settlement. Of the 652 agreements from July 2005 through July 2017, 619 were paired with a DOJ settlement, while 33 were the result of HHS-OIG independently exercising its exclusion authority. The total number of agreements in effect each year for the period we reviewed, which includes new agreements and ongoing agreements from past years, has decreased. Between 2006 and 2016 (the earliest and latest full years included in HHS-OIG’s database), the number of agreements in effect for any part of the calendar year decreased by 44 percent (see fig. 2). According to HHS-OIG officials, the goals of these agreements are to strengthen an entity’s compliance program, including Medicaid, for a period of five years. Excluding an entity from participation in federal health care programs. The total number of agreements in effect each year for the period we reviewed, which includes new agreements and ongoing agreements, has decreased by 44 percent. HHS-OIG officials said that two HHS-OIG officials typically conduct the type of provider, the size or complexity of the entity, length of the agreement, and the severity or complexity of the offenses that resulted in the agreement. According to internal HHS-OIG guidance regarding site visit protocol and agency officials we spoke to, during site visits, HHS-OIG’s exclusion authority is reserved for the highest-risk entities. HHS-OIG’s exclusion authority is reserved for the highest-risk entities. HHS-OIG’s exclusion authority is reserved for the highest-risk entities. HHS-OIG’s exclusion authority is reserved for the highest-risk entities. HHS-OIG officials said that in 2006 they first imposed a monetary threshold for damages caused to federal health care programs, above which the agency would pursue an agreement. HHS-OIG officials told us that they initially set this threshold at $100,000, but that in 2014 the agency increased it to $500,000, but that in 2014 the agency increased it to $500,000 for smaller entities (i.e., those eligible for IAs) and $500,000 for large entities (i.e., those eligible for Medicaid). HHS-OIG’s review of selected agreements found many of the same provisions. For example, among the 32 agreements we reviewed: All 32 agreements required the entity to engage an independent review organization to perform the agreement’s required reviews, including claims reviews. Entities have retained a variety of individuals and businesses as their independent review organization, ranging from small regional consulting firms to large national consulting or accounting firms. For agreements HHS-OIG has entered into from July 2005 through July 2017, our review of the agency’s data found that there were 173 unique associated independent review organizations. All 32 agreements had training and education requirements, although the specifics of the required training, such as the number of hours or the specific topics, varied across agreements. 28 of the 32 agreements reviewed required the entity to have a compliance officer. The four agreements that did not require this were two IAs for small group practices, one for a medical group practice, one for a medical group practice, and one for a clinic that named an individual practitioner as a party to the agreement. Although agreements shared many standard provisions, some provisions were unique to either CIAs or IAs. Many of the CIAs that we reviewed included provisions detailing specific responsibilities for the entity’s board of directors (18 of 23 CIAs) and requirements for certain high-level employees to annually certify that they were in compliance with federal health care program requirements and the provisions of the agreement (12 of 23 CIAs). None of the nine IA’s we reviewed included these provisions. Although agreements shared many standard provisions, some provisions were unique to either CIAs or IAs.

  " key elements for effectively aligning foreign assistance strategies in situations where multiple agencies are working together to deliver foreign assistance, such as CBSI. These elements include, among others, the establishment of interagency coordination mechanisms, integration of strategies with relevant higher- or lower-level strategies, and assessment of progress toward strategic goals through the articulation of desired results, activities to achieve the results, performance indicators, and monitoring and evaluation plans and reports. We found that agencies that establish strategies aligned with partner agencies’ activities, processes, and resources are better positioned to accomplish common goals, objectives, and outcomes. For foreign assistance that involves multiple agencies, strategies that consistently address agencies’ roles and responsibilities and interagency coordination mechanisms can help guide implementation and reduce potential program fragmentation. The absence of a functioning CBSI-wide planning and reporting mechanism leaves open the possibility that State’s and USAID’s existing planning efforts may be inadequate in ensuring that activities are effectively coordinated to achieve common goals, objectives, and outcomes. In 2016, INL officials explained that in order to ensure the reliability of the program monitoring data because of questions about the comparability of data collected across embassies. Generally, NADR funds are available for obligation for 1 year, and deem such funds to be obligated upon apportionment. Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR): State manages the NADR account, which funds contributions to organizations supporting nonproliferation and provides assistance to foreign countries for nonproliferation, antiterrorism, demining, export control assistance, and other related activities. Generally, NADR funds are available for obligation for 1 year, and deem such funds to be obligated upon apportionment. During the course of our work, INL officials at headquarters and overseas told us that program monitoring is conducted differently in every embassy, and program monitoring data is not defined or recorded in a standardized manner. These variations can result in discrepancies in how program performance data is defined and collected. In 2016, USAID contracted for an independent assessment of all of its CBSI activities. Since USAID implements CBSI in conjunction with other U.S. agencies, such as State, one of the objectives within the assessment was to determine the degree to which USAID’s activities were complementary with those of other U.S. agencies and whether there were instances of overlap. USAID manages the Development Assistance (DA) account. USAID manages the Development Assistance (DA) account, which responds to long-term challenges to human and economic security by funding activities in areas such as economic growth and education. Generally, DA funds are available for obligation for 2 fiscal years and must be disbursed within 5 years of the end of the period of availability for new obligations. In 2016, USAID contracted for an independent assessment of all of its CBSI activities. In 2012, the United States, Caribbean Community member states, and the Dominican Republic formally launched CBSI to strengthen regional cooperation on security. At its inception in 2010, CBSI’s aim was to increase citizen safety through provision of U.S. foreign assistance to CBSI partner countries to reduce illicit trafficking, improve public safety and security, and promote social justice; these three “pillars” This program, supported by both FMF and INCLE funds, aims to build maritime capacity of partner countries throughout the Caribbean. The team is composed of 15 Coast Guard and DOD engineers, technicians, specialists, and logisticians, based at U.S. Southern Command, who assist Caribbean maritime security forces with maintenance and sustainment issues. The advisors have worked to implement inventory management systems within CBSI countries and conduct regular site visits to CBSI countries to assist in the maintenance and logistics of maritime assets.

  " work has shown that: F-35B aircraft (including Marine Corps aircraft) were available (i.e., the aircraft were safe to fly, available for use, and able to perform at least one tasked mission) about 52 percent of the time from March 2017 through June 2017, which fell short of the 65-percent goal established by the Marine Corps for non-deployed units. While the Navy and the Marine Corps reported that sustainment funding accounts, such as those for depot maintenance and spare parts, have been funded at increased levels in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, efforts to improve spare parts availability take time to produce results due to long lead times for acquiring some items. In addition, Navy and Marine Corps aircraft face challenges associated with diminishing manufacturing sources and parts obsolescence. DOD has a program intended to manage these risks, but we reported in September 2017 that its implementation varied across DOD weapon system program offices. For example, F-35 aircraft were unable to fly 22 percent of the time because of parts shortages from January 2017 through August 7, 2017. Additionally, DOD’s capabilities to repair F-35 parts at military depots were 6 years behind schedule, which resulted in average part repair times that are twice that of the program’s objective. As DOD gains experience with the F-35, our work has shown that the Navy faces persistent challenges in completing maintenance on time and providing sufficient manning to its ships. Unless these challenges are addressed, the Navy will be hampered in its ability to rebuild readiness and prepare for the future. Our work has found that the Navy has been unable to complete ship and submarine maintenance on time, resulting in continuing schedule delays that reduce time for training and operations and create costly inefficiencies in a resource constrained environment. We have reported that the Navy faces persistent challenges in completing maintenance on time and providing sufficient manning to its ships. Unless these challenges are addressed, the Navy will be hampered in its ability to rebuild readiness and prepare for the future. Our work has found that the Navy has experienced increasing maintenance challenges as a high pace of operations has continued and maintenance has been deferred. Maintenance and personnel challenges also hinder readiness recovery of Navy aircraft. For the Marine Corps, our work has found that the Navy has been unable to complete ship and submarine maintenance on time, resulting in continuing schedule delays that are twice that of the program’s objective. As DOD gains experience with the F-35, our work has shown that the department has encountered additional challenges. Some of the depots experienced challenges attracting and retaining skilled personnel due to competition with nearby contractors that are able to offer higher pay, according to Navy depot officials. Similar to the shipyards, the aviation depots also lack experienced personnel, affecting the efficiency and quality of maintenance. For example, 41 percent of the skilled workers at Fleet Readiness Center Southwest have 2 years or fewer of experience. Workforce inexperience and attrition of skilled personnel were some of the reasons cited for machining defects detected in the landing gear for F/A-18, E-2, and C-2A aircraft by a recent Navy report.

We plan to issue a report examining DOD’s depot skill gaps, including those at the naval shipyards, later this month. Depot supply support may not be cost-effective. In June 2016, we reported that as the Navy moves forward in implementing its shipbuilding plan it will be paramount for the Navy to learn from and apply lessons learned from the past. Specifically, the Navy had not transferred certain functions to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) at the shipyards in the same manner as the Navy and Air Force did for their aviation depots. The Navy and Air Force aviation depots that transferred these functions to DLA had reaped a number of efficiencies in their supply operations, including a 10-percent reduction in backorders over a 5-year period. We recommended that the Navy to learn from and apply lessons learned from the past.

  "wide improvements. VHA officials have not systematically reviewed PATS data to assess program performance and identify potential system-wide improvements, goals of the patient advocacy program. Specifically, OPCC&CT officials stated that they reviewed PATS data in response to inquiries, but did not conduct systematic reviews of the data over time. For example, they did not track VAMC performance on responding to complaints in a timely manner or track the most common complaints across VAMCs to identify potential opportunities for system-wide improvements. OPCC&CT officials stated that they did not conduct systematic reviews of PATS data because VISN and VAMC officials were primarily responsible for these analyses. However, according to VHA’s handbook for the patient advocacy program, VHA officials have a responsibility to examine PATS data for trends across VAMCs and identify any areas for system-wide improvements. Officials from two of the five VISNs we interviewed stated that they did not perform any audits or checks of PATS data because VISN and VAMC officials were primarily responsible for these analyses. We also found inconsistencies in the extent to which VAMC officials entered complaints into PATS, with complaints always entered into PATS, with complaints always entered into PATS, while at other VAMCs some complaints were left unrecorded, according to officials. Officials from two of the five VISNs we interviewed stated that they did not perform any audits or checks of PATS data because VISN and VAMC officials were primarily responsible for these analyses. We also found inconsistencies in the extent to which VAMC officials entered complaints into PATS, with complaints always entered into PATS, while at other VAMCs some complaints were left unrecorded, according to officials. Officials from two of the five VISNs we interviewed stated that they did not perform any audits or checks of the patient advocacy program. Instead, it identifies the responsibilities of the VHA office that oversaw the program before OPCC&CT began overseeing the program in 2011. Not reviewing PATS data is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control for monitoring which require agencies to establish and operate monitoring activities, such as assessing the quality of performance over time, and evaluate the results. Further, not conducting systematic assessments of PATS data made it difficult for OPCC&CT to determine program performance, while at other VAMCs some complaints were left unrecorded, according to officials. Patient advocacy program staff enter veterans’ feedback in PATS using a report of contact (ROC) and assign one or more issue codes that generally describe the nature of the feedback, such as coordination of care. (See app. II for additional information on entering veterans’ feedback into PATS.) Each piece of feedback shared is categorized as either a request for information, compliment, or complaint. VHA’s handbook for the program specifies certain goals for data collection and resolution—specifically, that all complaints should be entered in PATS to enable a comprehensive understanding of veterans’ issues and concerns to, in turn, identify potential system-wide improvements; and CT convened a workgroup (which included several patient advocates) to determine whether the old training list was sufficient, and the workgroup shared its suggested updates with VISN- level coordinators for distribution to VAMCs in April 2017. We found that OPCC&CT has not developed an approach to routinely assess the training needs of patient advocates. Rather, OPCC&CT officials stated that they relied on VAMCs on the governance of the patient advocacy program, including clear definitions of reporting lines. (Recommendation 1) assess and provide guidance to VAMCs on appropriately staffing the patient advocacy program, including guidance on how to determine the appropriate number and type of staff. (Recommendation 2) develop an approach to routinely assess the training needs of patient advocates. (Recommendation 3) monitor the completion of training for patient advocates. In the absence of such an assessment, OPCC&CT did not provide guidance on how VAMCs should determine the appropriate number of administrative, technical, and clerical staff or type of patient advocates, such as lead patient advocates and service-level advocates. According to officials, this was because no assessment was conducted to identify what staff resources would be needed to meet the expectations of the program. In the absence of such an assessment, OPCC&CT instead relied on VAMC and VISN officials on how to determine program performance and identify potential system-wide improvements. In the absence of such an assessment, OPCC&CT, in FY 2017, a total of 1,391 program staff system-wide entered data in PATS. (Recommendation 4) monitor PATS data-entry practices to ensure all complaints are entered into PATS and that veterans’ feedback is coded consistently. (Recommendation 5) monitor PATS data-entry practices to ensure all complaints are entered into PATS and that veterans’ feedback is coded consistently.

  ", that the Select Agent Program did not consistently report violations of the Select Agent Program’s policies and procedures. The Select Agent Program did not consistently refer laboratories to investigative entities for violations of the select agent regulations or enforce regulations related to incidents involving incomplete inactivation. According to agency reports and inspectors we spoke with, inspectors often travel 30 percent to 50 percent or more of their time in performing their duties. This intensive workload and travel schedule has led to delays in both the issuing of inspection reports and processing of registration amendments. According to a 2017 CDC report, the CDC and APHIS components of the Select Agent Program manage fragmentation by collaborating on many aspects of the program, such as through maintaining frequent communication at the director level. They also said that the program had not developed a joint mission statement or strategic planning tools in the past because they prioritized other efforts in the past because they prioritized other efforts in recent years, including responding to incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2015, addressing recommendations from recent reports, and developing a new database for the Select Agent Program. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration provides public access to a library of lessons learned from historically significant, policy-making, and regulatory investigations conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the United States. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) provides public access to a library of lessons learned from historically significant, policy-making, and regulatory investigations conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the United States. The Select Agent Program does not fully meet our key elements of effective oversight. Specifically, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program does not have joint strategic planning documents to guide its oversight efforts, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan; it did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan and workforce plan; it did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan over the course of our review. The Select Agent Program does not fully meet our key elements of effective oversight. Specifically, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program regularly performs reviews of laboratories’ compliance with regulatory and program requirements, but these reviews may not target the activities that pose the highest risk to biological safety and security. Most laboratories registered with the Select Agent Program are registered with CDC (238 of 276). (See fig. 1 for information about the laboratories registered with the program.) In fiscal year 2016, CDC’s budget to manage its component of the Select Agent Program was about $21 million and APHIS’s was about $5.5 million. Select agent regulations govern the possession, use, and transfer of designated select agents. To apply for a certificate of registration, the laboratory is required to report violations of the Select Agent Program’s policies and procedures. CDC and APHIS also held a workshop for responsible officials from registered laboratories in December 2016 to disseminate program information; the workshop also provided the opportunity for attendees to interact. Many laboratory representatives told us that this was very helpful, and some noted that they had not had an opportunity to communicate and share lessons learned with responsible officials from other registered laboratories in the past. Some other regulatory sectors in the United States are also structurally independent from regulated laboratories as a mechanism to ensure independence. For example, prior to the creation of NRC in 1974, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was responsible for both promotion and oversight of the nuclear industry. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 established NRC as a separate, independent entity. According to a relevant Senate committee report, this was a response to growing criticism that there was a basic conflict between the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission’s regulation of the nuclear power industry and its development and promotion of new technology for the industry. In addition, once initial risks are identified, it is important for agencies to regularly re-examine risks to identify new risks or changes to existing risks. In addition, federal internal control standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. According to CDC’s Circular A-123 requires federal agencies to integrate risk management activities into their program management to help ensure they are effectively managing risks that could affect the achievement of agency objectives. According to the circular, once initial risks are identified, it is important for agencies to regularly re-examine risks to identify new risks or changes to existing risks. In addition, federal internal control standards state that management should explore options to improve independence, including reexamining previous reviews and assessing the need to address gaps in the",
  "stempo. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In written comments, DOD concurred with our two recommendations. DOD separately provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DOD’s written comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix I. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness; the Secretaries of the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy; the Commanding General of SOCOM.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. However, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has not fully implemented our recommendation because the instruction did not direct the Army and Marine Corps to develop quality control procedures for validating the accuracy of the perstempo data. In 2007, we found that Army and Marine Corps perstempo data were incomplete and inaccurate due to a lack of quality controls. We recommended that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness provide guidance that directs the Army and Marine Corps to develop quality control procedures for validating the accuracy of their perstempo data.

In 2016, we reported that the global security environment will likely continue to require significant reliance on U.S. military forces to respond to a range of demands, and the military services have attributed low readiness levels to increasingly long and frequent deployments, reduced force structure, and continuing and emerging demands. We also reported that DOD implementation and oversight of department-wide readiness rebuilding efforts did not fully include key elements of sound planning. We recommended, among other things, that DOD and the services establish comprehensive readiness goals and strategies for implementing them, as well as associated metrics that can In contrast, the services have taken differing approaches, with the Army, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps having no specific and measurable thresholds. Through providing specific and measurable department-wide perstempo thresholds in DOD guidance or directing the services and SOCOM to establish and follow service-specific thresholds for its service members, DOD will be better able to judge whether service members are spending too much total time away from home and, if so, whether there have been any associated effects on military readiness. In part due to the incompleteness of the perstempo data, an official within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness told us that the office cannot monitor perstempo even though section 136 of title 10 makes the office responsible for doing so. In addition, officials from the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation told us that a December 2017 Defense Manpower Data Center analysis indicated that perstempo data are missing records for at least 145,000 individuals that deployed in fiscal years 2014-2016.",
  " have not been implemented, but could assist the department in addressing challenges monitoring and ensuring compliance with its CFIUS mitigation agreements. For example, DOD’s Instruction establishes a CFIUS Monitoring Committee, made up of relevant DOD component reviewers, to serve as the focal point for DOD monitoring. If these conclusions are reached, the national security review ends, and the transaction proceeds. However, if, for example, an agency identifies an unresolved national security risk, the agency may draft a risk-based analysis and CFIUS may undertake a national security investigation. In addition to challenges identifying non-notified transactions within MIBP, DOD component reviewers’ awareness of the non-notified transaction process varied across the components that we spoke with, and participation in this part of the process is ad hoc. For example, five of the nine components in our sample said they do not have processes in place to identify transactions that have not been voluntarily filed but present risks to national security that could warrant CFIUS review. Officials from four components we spoke with said they do not have processes in place to identify transactions that have not been voluntarily filed but present risks to national security that could warrant CFIUS review. According to DOD officials, they recently conducted a data call to the military departments to identify the locations that they consider to be at risk from foreign encroachment. DOD plans to use this information to develop guidance, not related to the CFIUS process, to assess the risks that test and training ranges face from foreign encroachment. In a December 2014 report, we recommended that DOD develop and implement guidance for assessing the risks that test and training ranges face from foreign encroachment. However, officials from most other DOD components told us they either are not involved or occasionally review non-notified transactions once MIBP identifies them, and they do not proactively perform non-notified transaction research, and seek legislative action to address risks posed by these investments as appropriate. (Recommendation 3) Following the department’s efforts to identify critical locations and develop and implement guidance assessing risks to these locations from foreign encroachment, the Secretary of Defense should assess what additional authorities, if any, may be necessary to assess the risks that test and training ranges face from foreign encroachment. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should clearly define objectives and risk tolerances; identify, analyze, and respond to risks, and seek legislative action as appropriate. (Recommendation 4) The Secretary of the Treasury should provide clarification to parties filing a notice of a transaction with CFIUS that for filings involving multiple locations, geographic coordinates are required to be part of the notification. DOD’s Instruction identifies CFIUS-related responsibilities and processes for reviewing transactions, but that policy has not yet been completed or communicated to components through DOD’s Instruction, or otherwise. As a result, the components lack clear and consistent guidance on how to review transactions for these specific types of national security concerns facing the department. For example, officials at four components said that it can be difficult to explain the risks associated with foreign investment in U.S. businesses developing emerging technologies, particularly if the technology in question is not already being used in a defense program or not While CFIUS is aware of the joint venture and that it could result in the same transfer of technology CFIUS attempted to prevent by proposing to prohibit the original transaction, the committee has not yet determined whether it can be addressed through the CFIUS process because CFIUS is only able to review certain types of joint ventures. According to Treasury officials, when these circumstances arise they are sometimes able to review the joint venture, depending on the structure of the investment and whether it meets the definition of a covered transaction pursuant to law and associated regulations. Yet, even if this joint venture is ultimately reviewed as a covered transaction, the technology that DOD and CFIUS were originally concerned with may have already been transferred to the foreign acquirer. In February 2018, we reported on CFIUS workload and staffing as well as stakeholder perspectives on potential changes to CFIUS. We found that as the volume and complexity of CFIUS reviews have increased in recent years, member agency officials have expressed concerns that current CFIUS staffing levels may not be adequate to complete core functions of the committee. We recommended that Treasury should coordinate member agencies’ efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions. Treasury agreed with our recommendation. In the absence of voluntary reporting by the parties involved or independent discovery of the transaction, it is possible that CFIUS may not review a non-notified covered transaction that could pose a risk to national security. We also found that MIBP officials, they are concerned about foreign-owned enterprises exploiting critical technologies by structuring investments to avoid the CFIUS process, and noted that multiple investment structures exist that can allow foreign acquirers to gain access and influence over critical capabilities. We found that the 22 mitigation agreements implemented by DOD during this period included the DOD and CFI",
  "). The orphan drug marketing approvals from 2008 to 2017 benefitted from at least one type of FDA’s four primary expedited programs (accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, or priority review). Most orphan drug approvals in each year received priority review, while less than half received accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation, or fast track designation in the year the drug was approved. (See fig. 7.) Very few (six) orphan drug approvals were granted all four of these expedited programs in the year approved. In addition, FDA’s fiscal year 2019 budget justification includes a request for funds to develop clinical trial networks to create an understanding of the natural history and clinical outcomes of rare diseases. Significance of ODA incentives in fostering drug development. Although many stakeholders we spoke with categorized the ODA’s incentives as significant to rare disease drug development, two stakeholder groups we spoke with—industry experts and drug manufacturers—largely categorized the incentives as less important than did other stakeholders. For example, two of four drug manufacturers we interviewed told us that their company’s drug development decisions are based on the natural history and clinical outcomes of rare diseases.

OOPD granted orphan designation to 26 applications missing required information. Specifically, we found that OOPD granted designation to 11 applications where the reviewer did not record prior orphan designation history, to 13 applications where the reviewer did not document independent verification of the manufacturer’s population estimate, and to 2 applications where the reviewer did not document independent verification of the manufacturer’s population estimate. In cases where the background information was incomplete or there was no documentation of independent verification of the manufacturer’s population estimate, there also was no evidence that the secondary reviewer verified the completeness of these sections of the review templates. Approximately 71 percent of orphan designation applications received by FDA from 2008 to 2017 were for drugs intended to treat diseases affecting 100,000 or fewer people. In addition, half of the applications received during this time frame were for drugs intended to treat populations of 50,000 or fewer people. (See fig. 4.) For applications that OOPD granted orphan designation, the population estimates for the diseases they were intended to treat ranged from 0 to 199,966 people. Of 3,491 orphan designation applications OOPD received from 2008 to 2017, over half were for drugs intended to treat populations of 50,000 or fewer people. (See fig. 4.)

  "Our review, we identified cases in which limited market information made such determinations more involved. For example, the Army was working with a contractor to acquire repair and upgrade services for navigation systems. The contractor said the services were commercial, but when the contracting officer conducted market research to determine the commerciality of the services, she found no similar services available in the commercial market. According to a contracting official, the Army’s particular units had to be nuclear hardened to withstand an explosion and needed some functional interfaces added, which made finding a similar commercial service difficult. In the end, the DCMA’s Commercial Item Group officials completed an on-site review of the manufacturing process to gain an in-depth understanding of the services provided. Using this additional information, the contracting officer deemed the services commercial. In contrast, for a previous report on commercial item acquisitions, we reviewed selected Air Force contracts for information technology services and video teleconferencing design and installation. Because these items and services are available in the commercial marketplace, the availability of information helped the contracting officers efficiently determine that the items were commercial and that the prices were fair and reasonable. Contracting officials from our case studies had difficulty obtaining information from contractors after they could not find adequate information in the marketplace. In January 2018, DOD revised its regulations and corresponding procedures, guidance, and information related to the procurement of commercial items to reflect recent legislative changes. The DFARS was updated to provide guidance to contracting officers for making a commercial item determination. The Navy obtained information from the Air Force, which was procuring the same radio at a lower price. The Navy obtained information from the Air Force, which was procuring the same radio at a lower price. In January 2018, DOD revised its regulations and corresponding procedures, guidance, and information related to the procurement of commercial items to reflect recent legislative changes. The DFARS was updated to provide guidance to contracting officers for making price reasonableness determinations, promote consistency in making commercial item determinations (including updating guidance regarding the use of prior determinations), and expand opportunities for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DOD. The department also updated its Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items, which includes information on how to define, determine, and price commercial items, to reflect the regulatory changes. Also in January 2018, a DOD advisory panel established to help streamline the defense acquisition process released a report with recommendations to revise definitions related to commercial buying and minimize government-unique terms applicable to commercial buying. During the pre-award process for commercial procurement actions over $1 million, two distinct determinations take place: 1. a contracting officer must determine in writing whether a product or service being procured is commercial, but did not provide any documents to support its assertion. After several requests for information on commercial sales data, the contracting officer must determine if the offered price is fair and reasonable. According to the DOD Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items, the government’s ability to acquire commercial items is limited. The DOD Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items is available at no charge on the DOD website at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. Our objectives were to: (1) identify the factors that influenced the Department of Defense’s (DOD) commercial item and price reasonableness determinations and (2) assess the extent to which DOD has taken steps to make information available to help make these determinations. In addition, where the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DFARS differed in terminology (e.g., the FAR noted a requirement for “data” to determine price reasonableness but the DFARS noted a requirement for “information” to determine price reasonableness because sales to foreign governments were not considered commercial sales. Examples of Reasons Contractors Cited for Not Providing Data: One prime contractor told us that some subcontractors are unwilling to provide information, such as unredacted invoices, to them and therefore prime contractors cannot provide this information to the government. Some subcontractors we interviewed explained that certain information, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DFARS differed in terminology (e.g., the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DFARS differed in terminology (e.g., the FAR noted a requirement for “data” to determine price reasonableness but the DFARS noted a requirement for “information”), the table and report use the DFARS terminology.

  "In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded in Roe v. Wade that a woman has a fundamental right protected by the U.S. Constitution to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy. However, the Court also recognized that a state may have an interest sufficient to regulate abortion after the first trimester of the pregnancy or proscribe abortion after the fetus reaches viability, the point at which the fetus could live outside the womb. In the case of medical abortions, federal law does not specifically require Medicaid coverage of the prescription drugs used to terminate a pregnancy. However, state Medicaid programs that opt to cover prescription drugs—which is the case in all 51 states—are generally required to cover outpatient drugs of any manufacturer participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In doing so, HHS noted that while CMS encourages states to design their Medicaid programs to meet the needs of local beneficiaries, states must operate their programs consistent with all applicable federal laws, including those referenced in our report. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. HHS’s comments are reprinted in appendix III. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. In addition, the agency will consider a state’s authority to cover outpatient drugs of any manufacturer participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. There were also other, smaller gaps in the states’ information. For example, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of HHS, and other interested parties.

To inform its oversight of Medicaid, CMS relies on state-reported data that contain information on multiple aspects of the program. States claiming federal funding for Medicaid services, including abortions, are required to report quarterly expenditures to CMS on the form CMS-64. CMS uses these data to pay states for the federal share of program spending and the agency is responsible for ensuring that federal payments are made appropriately. Most recently, in 2016, the Court found that two Texas laws regulating abortion providers offered few, if any, health benefits and posed a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions. Therefore, the Court found that these two Texas laws constituted an undue burden and were unconstitutional. Through provider interviews, we identified multiple factors that could present challenges to women accessing abortions, but the extent to which these factors were present in a state varied, as did their effect on access. In addition, the studies we reviewed examined some of these factors more than others, including the fact that obtaining Medicaid payment is challenging; involves multiple, often unclear requirements; and frequently results in denied claims. One of these providers noted that not obtaining Medicaid payment puts additional pressure on already strained resources, affecting its ability to cover abortions for women in general. Conversely, two providers operating in states with broader Medicaid abortion coverage stated that they frequently submit claims for abortions and receive payment. State-reported information on denied abortion claims suggests that the difficulty the selected providers faced in obtaining Medicaid payment for abortions could exist in other states. For example, among the 15 states reporting information on denials of payment for abortions in circumstances eligible for federal funding, we reviewed available documents and found that there was no evidence that denials of payment for abortions in circumstances of rape, incest, or life endangerment were the most common reasons for denying Medicaid payment for abortions. We reviewed available documents and found that there was no evidence that denials of payment for abortions in circumstances of rape, incest, or life endangerment could change the effect on access. This study found that while a waiting period requiring two in-person visits could delay care, the effect of waiting periods that required fewer in-person visits was not significant. Finally, for mandatory counseling, the studies we reviewed rarely found that the factor had a statistically significant effect on a measure of abortion access.",
  "These regulations. Among other provisions, OFCCP’s regulations generally require that covered contractors prepare and maintain an affirmative action program (AAP). While OFCCP may be able to detect underrepresentation of particular minority groups during its reviews, the office reviews only 2 percent of federal contractor establishments each year. OFCCP officials said that they would need to amend their regulations in order to require disaggregated race/ethnicity information for placement goals on AAPs. The officials said disaggregating race in placement goals could help an establishment determine how to tailor outreach accordingly or better identify impediments to its equal employment opportunity efforts. However, they have not pursued this regulatory change because of competing priorities on their regulatory agenda. OFCCP’s mission includes holding federal contractors responsible for the legal requirements to take affirmative action and not discriminate against protected groups. However, not requiring contractors to set placement goals for each minority group may hinder OFCCP’s ability to effectively achieve this mission. In addition, OFCCP has not reviewed key aspects of its current approach to selecting entities for review. In addition, OFCCP has acknowledged in a 2016 report that technology companies and subcontractors are generally required to submit their claims to the agency. In addition, federal contractors and subcontractors are generally required to take affirmative action and can afford to hire private attorneys to sue in state court rather than go through the EEOC. Moreover, they said that some states, including California, have stronger employment discrimination laws that allow for better remedies than federal laws, which could lead employees to file charges at the state level rather than with the EEOC. In addition, EEOC has acknowledged in a 2016 report that technology companies often offer financial incentives to current employees to submit their claims to private arbiters rather than courts, can also deter workers from bringing discrimination claims to the agency, leaving significant violations in entire segments of the workforce unreported. The report stated that an increasing number of arbitration policies have added bans on class actions that prevent individuals from joining together to challenge practices in any forum. The report concluded that the use of arbitration policies hinders EEOC’s ability to detect and remedy potential systemic violations. In addition, the use of compliance officers, who evaluate contractors’ compliance with various requirements, according to agency officials. In addition, one of these representatives said that technology companies often offer financial incentives to current employees to submit their claims to private arbiters rather than courts, can also deter workers from bringing discrimination claims to the agency, leaving significant violations in entire segments of the workforce unreported. In addition, on occasions when EEOC receives a complaint not within its purview, such as cases that involve veteran status, but over which it believes OFCCP has jurisdiction, it will refer the complaint to OFCCP. We previously found that the use of arbitration policies hinders EEOC’s ability to detect and remedy potential systemic violations. Researchers report that because OFCCP was not able to identify which factors are associated with risk of noncompliance, the agency does not have reasonable assurance that it is focusing its efforts on those contractors at greatest risk of not following nondiscrimination or affirmative action requirements. OFCCP agreed with recommendations we made to address diversity in the technology sector including research and outreach efforts. In May 2016, citing the technology sector as a source for an which is part of the compliance review process. Using 2015 OFCCP compliance evaluation data, we previously reported that close to 85 percent of contractor establishments across all sectors did not submit an AAP within 30 days of being scheduled for an OFCCP compliance evaluation, as required by OFCCP policy. Officials told us of the potential need for a more flexible set of investigatory tools or sanctions, such as subpoena power to speed up data-gathering or penalties for delays in providing information, in order to obtain accurate and timely information. In the case of incomplete data, OFCCP officials said one option is to enter into an agreement with the contractor whereby the contractor will gather the missing data, and OFCCP will monitor the contractor’s efforts and review detailed records at a later date. However, they said that such an agreement could give the contractor an opportunity to modify the data in the contractor’s favor. (Recommendation 4) The Director of OFCCP should evaluate the current approach used for identifying entities for compliance review and determine whether modifications are needed to reflect current workplace structures and locations or to ensure that subcontractors are included. (Recommendation 5) The Director of OFCCP should assess the quality of the methods used by OFCCP to incorporate consideration of disparities by industry into its process for selecting contractor establishments for compliance evaluation. It should use the results of this assessment in finalizing its procedures for identifying contractor establishments at greatest risk of noncompliance. (Recommendation 4) The Director of OFCCP should evaluate the current approach used for identifying entities for compliance review and determine whether modifications are needed to reflect current workplace structures and locations or determine whether modifications are needed to reflect current workplace structures and locations or to ensure that",
  "s and programmers expressed concern that some third-party device companies might reduce the market power of MVPDs and may restrict what they can do and what they can charge for set-top boxes—as well as potentially spurring innovation in how they offer access to their MVPD services. While the 2017 video competition report touches on consumer choice for both services and for devices, it does not discuss the extent to which new choices for services have affected the importance of consumer choice for devices. Furthermore, this analysis does not consider what level of consumer choice for devices must exist for the market for devices to be “fully competitive.” While FCC’s former Chairman believed that new regulations were needed to fulfill the requirements of the Act, the current Chairman believes that any reduced ad revenues would, in turn, reduce the ability to invest in content. Seven of the 11 experts and analysts we interviewed reported that the proposed rule could reduce the value of consumer choice for devices. Furthermore, some stakeholders told us that they believed the possible negative effects of the proposed rule could have especially affected independent and diverse programmers such as Vme, a national Spanish language network. According to one independent and diverse programmer we interviewed, its business is dependent upon agreements with MVPDs that distribute its programming. Those agreements include a range of terms including advertising restrictions and channel placement. To the extent a third party could modify the content—such as by overlaying advertising—that programmer would have a harder time negotiating with MVPDs, potentially reducing the value of consumer choice for devices.

Those agreements include a range of terms including advertising restrictions and channel placement. To the extent a third party could modify the content—such as by overlaying advertising—that programmer would have a harder time negotiating with MVPDs, potentially reducing the compensation received from MVPDs for carrying its channel, thus harming its business model. Additionally, according to one independent and diverse programmer we interviewed, its business is dependent upon agreements with MVPDs that distribute its programming. Those agreements include a range of terms including advertising restrictions and channel placement. One MVPD told us that although it sees video providers moving to apps on their own in the future, there will still be an option for consumers to access content from their set-top box. This MVPD has made upgrades to its set-top box to provide more features and has incorporated Internet video applications such as Netflix directly into its set-top box. Additionally, according to a letter written by the Copyright Office, the proposed rule could have interfered with the rights of copyright owners to license their works by requiring MVPDs to provide content to third parties that would not necessarily have a contractual relationship with the copyright owner. According to Kagan, subscriptions to content aggregators and direct to consumer Internet-based services are expected to grow from 109 million in 2016 to 137 million in 2020. Many new Internet video services have launched since 2005, and there has been a particularly large growth since 2014. (See fig. 2.) Subscribers can access Internet-based video services using many different Internet-connected devices and services, but only three said they foresee the set-top box still playing a role in their service in the near future, and only three said their customers may be able to access their subscriptions solely on alternative devices without the need for a set-top box. One MVPD told us that although it sees video providers moving to apps on their own in the future, there will still be an option for consumers to access content from their set-top box. This MVPD has made upgrades to its set-top box to provide more features and has incorporated Internet video applications such as Netflix directly into its set-top box. Additionally, eight out of the 11 experts and industry analysts we interviewed said that they expect the set-top box to continue to be needed for traditional provider services for households in the future. One expert stated that the set-top box is the most efficient way to access and deliver programming, and that it remains the best solution for consumers and an important component of video programming. While the Internet has provided consumers with more choice for accessing video programming without subscribing to an MVPD and using an associated set-top box, consumers must have broadband access to be able to use these alternative products. However, FCC, in a 2016 broadband progress report, estimated that consumers do not have broadband access. FCC, in a 2016 broadband progress report, estimated that 10 percent of the population does not have adequate access to in-home fixed broadband Internet and that it remains the best solution for consumers and an important component of video programming. However, public interest organizations we interviewed stated they believe that the low rate of adoption of CableCARD devices was due to limited functionality. One of the 11 experts and industry analysts we interviewed said that",
  " with public and private partners in the Philippines to implement the Reducing Opportunities for Unlawful Transport of Endangered Species program, which aims to increase enforcement capacity at ports of entry in Vietnam and other countries. The Implementation Plan designates various U.S. agencies to lead or participate in achieving CWT-related objectives but are not dedicated solely to CWT. For example, USAID implemented the Ecosystems Improved for Sustainable Fisheries project in the Philippines, designed to conserve marine biodiversity, enhance ecosystem productivity, and improve law enforcement at fisheries to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. DOJ, NOAA, and Homeland Security also support efforts to combat wildlife trafficking in the United States and Asia. For example, instead of providing traditional, onetime classroom training, officials plan to establish mentoring and on-the-job training programs in which officials in similar roles teach one another. This facilitates learning and may help identify CWT champions, enhancing sustainability and effectiveness, according to program officials. One USAID CWT program in Asia conducted a midterm evaluation, but State and FWS have not conducted a midterm evaluation, but State and FWS have not conducted a variety of capacity-building activities. State has not conducted a variety of capacity-building activities. According to DOJ officials, FWS has not conducted a variety of capacity-building activities. FWS has not conducted any evaluations of INL CWT activities because none meet State’s criteria for completing an evaluation, including funding and duration thresholds, according to a State official. FWS has not conducted any evaluations of INL CWT activities because none meet State’s criteria for funding and duration thresholds, according to a State official. FWS has not conducted any evaluations of INL CWT activities because none meet State’s criteria for completing an evaluation, including funding and duration thresholds, according to a State official. FWS has not conducted any evaluations of INL CWT activities because none meet State’s criteria for funding and duration thresholds. FWS has not conducted any evaluations of INL CWT activities because none meet State’s criteria for funding and duration thresholds, according to a State official. FWS has not conducted any evaluations of its CWT activities in Southeast Asia. We have previously reported that key issues agencies should consider include whether participating agencies have clarified the roles and responsibilities of participants in collaborative efforts and whether participating agencies have agreed to a process for making and enforcing decisions. Seizure data from FWS and NOAA provide a helpful illustration of wildlife trafficking. In March 2016, the Task Force released an annual progress report that describes U.S. government accomplishments; however, according to an official, the Task Force does not plan to issue a progress report in 2017 due to vacancies in leadership and because agencies are working on a similar report planned for completion sometime in 2017, in response to the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016. USAID’s Evaluation Policy states that for each project, consideration will be given during the design phase to the performance evaluation that will be undertaken. The ARREST program conducted a midterm evaluation, and we assessed We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and to the Secretaries of Commerce, Homeland Security, Thailand, and Vietnam, we interviewed officials from DOI, State, USAID, the Department of Homeland Security, and officials in the field as examples of wildlife consumption in China and Southeast Asia, but other wildlife, such as pangolins, bears, sharks, and sea turtles are also named among the wildlife being consumed. The new implementing partner also brought in a law enforcement expert to help ensure that training and related activities will be appropriate, according to USAID officials. In addition, the new USAID program specifies that coordination with other agencies is required, and USAID conducted a regional workshop in March 2017 to serve as a mechanism for coordination. However, even after this conference, officials indicated that some agencies still had not agreed on the appropriate balance for how implementing partners should collaborate with U.S. law enforcement on criminal investigations. According to State and FWS officials, differences in agency views of their roles have hindered U.S. efforts to cooperate with a foreign government and confuse foreign government officials who may not realize that an implementing partner is not a U.S. government agency and thus does not have the same authority. Table 3 displays examples of wildlife consumed and trafficked in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam. Table 3 displays examples of wildlife consumed and trafficked in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam, according to U.S. government, foreign government, and NGO officials in-location and at DOI Headquarters. The International Fund for Animal Welfare has reported that China is the world’s largest consumer of illegal wildlife products due to its demand for ivory, rhino horn, pangolin scales, bear bile, tiger bone, and shark fin soup. In 2016, ILEA Bangkok sponsored two FWS-led CWT training courses and one environmental crimes course led by",
  "funded priority’ means a program or mission requirement that (1) has not been selected for funding in the applicable proposed budget, (2) is necessary to fulfill a requirement associated with an operational need, and it is not clear how these boards set objectives or priorities among outcomes to be achieved. The Coast Guard provided some documentation detailing how regional DLM planning board inputs and subsequent decisions were linked to decision-making criteria for one regional DLM planning board meeting hosted by one of its nine Districts. Table 7, among other things, shows the limited extent of documentation to substantiate Coast Guard decisions. However, the Coast Guard did not meet this leading practice because it could not demonstrate, with documentation, how decisions were linked to criteria for its PC&I planning board meetings, central DLM planning board meetings, or any other regional DLM planning board meeting. Without the full range of information on which planning board decisions were made, neither we, nor the Coast Guard, could substantiate the extent to which the Coast Guard followed its processes or evaluate whether its processes for managing shore infrastructure projects were sound. The Coast Guard did not meet this leading practice because it could not demonstrate, with documentation, how decisions were linked to criteria for its PC&I planning board meetings, or any other regional DLM planning board meeting. Without the full range of information on which planning board decisions were made, neither we, nor the Coast Guard, could substantiate the extent to which the Coast Guard followed its processes or evaluate whether its processes for managing shore infrastructure projects were sound. OMB guidance calls for agencies to use information to support decision- making, such as whether or not the Coast Guard’s shore infrastructure and into the processes the Coast Guard uses to maintain, repair, and replace these assets. We conducted a review of the Coast Guard’s shore infrastructure and the extent to which Coast Guard’s shore infrastructure and the extent to which Coast Guard employs quality control mechanisms, such as automated edit checks. Additionally, in August 2018, the Coast Guard informed us that its data on its shore infrastructure may not be complete if field inspectors did not identify problems at the facilities they inspected. Coast Guard officials also told us in July 2018 that not all projects on the Coast Guard’s PC&I backlog have cost estimates. As a result, the Coast Guard is to identify if any new maintenance-related deficiencies exist at the facility and add them to the backlog of projects, review the previous backlog, and verify that the Coast Guard’s shore facilities’ inventory records are correct. This process is intended to help define the current conditions of assets and set priorities among outcomes to be achieved. Additionally, according to OMB, agencies are to have a plan for periodic, results-oriented evaluations of program effectiveness, and agencies should discuss the results of these evaluations when proposing reauthorizations. Establishing guidance for planning boards to document project prioritization decision-making, as well as the impact of trade-off decisions, would allow agency decision makers, and Congress, to better understand Coast Guard priorities and how shore infrastructure project priorities might potentially affect other priorities. The Coast Guard was unable to provide documentation showing how it prioritized projects for a number of reasons, including whether or not the Coast Guard’s PC&I and DLM planning board meetings had cost estimates. Similarly, Coast Guard budget requests have not been in alignment with its PC&I targets for recapitalization. For example, Coast Guard recapitalization targets show a far greater need for funding than the allotments from the appropriations it requested between fiscal years 2012 and 2019. Specifically, Coast Guard officials stated that funding for maintenance projects cannot be disaggregated from overall OLM funding. The Coast Guard’s 2017 shore infrastructure annual report states that industry studies establish that the most effective maintenance organizations spend about 17 percent of their staff labor effort on corrective maintenance (i.e., repairs) and 83 percent on preventative maintenance (e.g., activities such as changing buildings systems’ filters and oil, resealing pavement surfaces, or repainting buildings). However, Coast Guard officials at 5 of the 6 CEUs told us that the most effective maintenance organizations spend about 17 percent of their staff labor effort on corrective maintenance (i.e., repairs) and 83 percent on preventative maintenance (e.g., activities such as changing buildings systems’ filters and oil, resealing pavement surfaces, or repainting buildings). However, Coast Guard’s analysis of OLM records indicated that 66 percent of their facilities’ staff labor effort was used for corrective maintenance. This imbalance indicates that fewer funds are available for preventative maintenance than industry studies suggest, which could increase costs and affect service lives if preventative maintenance cannot be performed to the extent necessary. The annual report further stated that the significant investment needed for corrective maintenance reflects the state of the Coast Guard’s aging infrastructure and the strain it places on maintenance personnel. Moreover, Coast Guard officials at 5 of the 6 CEUs told us that the Coast Guard officials told us that",

  "DOD has defined audit readiness as having the capabilities in place that allow an auditor to plan and perform a full financial statement audit that results in actionable feedback to DOD. In DOD’s May 2016 FIAR Plan Status Report, the DON initially asserted that it would be audit ready with regard to real property (including construction-in-progress) for the existence and completeness assertions by June 2016 and with regard to the valuation assertion by March 2017. Subsequently, in DOD’s November 2016 FIAR Plan Status Report, the DON asserted that it would be audit ready for the existence, completeness, and valuation assertions by March 2017. In DOD’s May 2017 FIAR Plan Status Report, the DON reported that it would be audit ready for the existence, completeness, and valuation assertions by March 2017. In DOD’s May 2017 FIAR Plan Status Report, the DON reported that it would be audit ready for the existence, completeness, and valuation assertions by March 2017. In DOD’s May 2017 FIAR Plan Status Report, the DON reported that it had validated that the existence and completeness assertions for real property. Ultimately, the DON reported in DOD’s November 2017 FIAR Plan Status Report that it had achieved audit readiness for the existence and completeness assertions and was in the process of determining audit readiness for the valuation assertion. In August 2016, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board issued Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 50, which allows reporting entities to apply alternative valuation methods in establishing opening balances of general property, plant, and equipment (G-PP&E). Such alternative valuation methods may be applied in reporting periods beginning after September 30, 2016. SFFAS No. 50 permits each reporting entity to use alternative valuation methods in establishing opening balances of general property, plant, and equipment (G-PP&E). Such alternative valuation methods may be applied in reporting periods beginning after September 30, 2016. SFFAS No. 50 permits each reporting entity to use alternative methods when presenting financial statements, or one or more line items, (1) for the first time or (2) after a period during which existing systems could not provide the information necessary for producing financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, based on the iNFADS property record, the building appeared to be a relatively new building based on the recorded placed in service date of August 16, 2016, the date it was found. SFFAS No. 50 permits each reporting entity to use alternative methods when presenting financial statements, or one or more line items, (1) for the first time or (2) after a period during which existing systems could not provide the information necessary for producing financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Navy considers these substantial delays in getting to the final version of the DD-1354 to be an obstacle to timely documenting the final costs of buildings that are acquired and placed in service after the Navy’s opening balances have been established, based on alternative valuation methods permitted by SFFAS No. 50. As of March 2018, the Navy has not made an unreserved assertion attesting According to Navy officials, the Navy erroneously included $5 million in net book value, $403 million in accumulated depreciation, and $8 million in net book value, as assets in the financial statements as of September 30, 2016. For example, one building coded as nonfunctional that we observed during our site visits was constructed in 1909, with a PRV of over $5 million in iNFADS. The building has been vacant and unusable since September 11, 2002, but was included as an asset in the financial statements for fiscal year 2016. According to federal accounting standards, fully impaired assets, such as nonfunctional buildings, should not be included in an entity’s financial statements and related notes. Specifically, SFFAS No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant, and Equipment, states that G-PP&E, which includes real property, shall be removed from the accounts along with the associated accumulated depreciation if the asset no longer provides service to the operations of the entity. Moreover, SFFAS No. 44, Accounting for Impairment of General Property, Plant, and Equipment Remaining in Use, reiterates the requirement of SFFAS No. 6 by stating that fully impaired assets should be removed from the G-PP&E accounts along with the associated accumulated depreciation if, prior to disposal, the asset no longer provides service to the operations of the entity. Moreover, SFFAS No. 44, Accounting for Impairment of General Property, Plant, and Equipment Remaining in Use, reiterates the requirement of SFFAS No. 6 by stating that SFFAS No. 44, Accounting for Impairment of General Property, Plant, and Equipment Remaining in Use, reiterates the requirement of SFFAS No. 6 by stating that SFFAS No. 44, Accounting for Impairment of General Property, Plant, and Equipment Remaining in Use",
  ", provide strategic guidance for this new program by providing accountability for both internal and external stakeholders, and ensure that program goals are met. A program management plan could also provide practical benefits, such as helping ensure that WMATA’s extended overnight work hours are efficiently implemented and that sufficient resources are devoted to the program. To examine progress toward goals in WMATA’s track preventive maintenance program and how the program compares with leading program management practices, we reviewed WMATA documentation about the program, interviewed WMATA officials, and analyzed track- defect data and electrical-wayside-fire data provided by WMATA for fiscal years 2016 through 2018—which were the only years detailed track defect and electrical fire incident data were available. Additionally, though states play a role in safety oversight of rail transit systems through state safety oversight programs, WMATA lacks assurance that the program is comprehensively designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the program’s success. Moreover, a program management plan that draws on information from a comprehensive risk assessment would provide WMATA officials with the assurance that they are prepared to respond to current and future challenges that could threaten the long-term viability of the program. WMATA lacks assurance that the program is comprehensively designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the program’s success. Moreover, a program management plan that draws on information from a comprehensive risk assessment would provide WMATA officials with the assurance that they are prepared to respond to current and future challenges that could threaten the long-term viability of the program. WMATA lacks assurance that the program is comprehensively designed to address risks affecting the safety of the rail system or other risks that could hinder the program’s success. Finally, WMATA has the authority to assume temporary, direct safety oversight of a rail transit system if it finds the state safety oversight program is inadequate, among other things. After FTA conducted a safety management inspection and issued a safety directive with 91 required actions, it found WMATA’s state safety- oversight program to be inadequate and assumed direct safety-oversight of WMATA in October 2015. Finally, although WMATA developed the track preventive maintenance program to prevent the need for another emergency repair project like SafeTrack, without a formal program management plan, the WMATA employees charged with managing and implementing the program lack an important document to guide their decision-making to meet that objective and the agency’s overall strategic objectives. Developing a program management plan would outline the specific requirements to assess capital projects and the capital planning process. Leading practices contained in the Executive Guide also recommend that organizations have defined processes for ranking and selecting projects for capital funding. In addition, the Executive Guide noted that organizations have defined processes for ranking and selecting projects for capital funding. In addition, the Executive Guide noted that organizations find it beneficial to rank projects because the number of requested projects often exceeds available funding. Officials from all five of the peer transit agencies we spoke with told us they had or planned to develop documented processes for making capital investment decisions. For example, officials from four of the five peer transit agencies we spoke with said they use a project scoring and ranking system in their capital planning process, and As of October 2018, WMATA’s track preventive maintenance program was completed. WMATA’s track preventive maintenance program was completed in December 2017. WMATA’s track preventive maintenance program was completed in December 2017. WMATA’s track preventive maintenance program was completed in December 2017. WMATA’s track preventive maintenance program was completed in December 2017. WMATA officials attributed the increase to a certain sub-set of track defect incidents such as those caused by loose fasteners and defective switches. According to WMATA, these track defect incidents can be addressed through its track geometry, torqueing, and switch maintenance initiatives. WMATA addresses other types of track defects, such as rail breaks and third-rail defects, through its capital program. However, according to WMATA, track defects attributable to the capital program are still included as part of the overall goal to provide, among other things, high quality asset data for informed decision-making, including for capital planning. WMATA’s new capital planning process could address some of the weaknesses it identified in the previous process, such as better distinguishing capital needs (investments in groups of related assets) from capital projects (investments in specific assets). However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures to guide the developed performance measures. WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures to guide the developed performance measures. WMATA concurred in part, or with the intent of four of the recommendations, and disagreed with a fifth. WMATA officials did not discuss the Reliability Centered Maintenance process in detail or provide documentation that allowed us to evaluate how this process might interface with the current track preventive maintenance program. As a result, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures to guide the developed performance measures to assess capital projects and the capital planning process.",
  "ICA in the form of assistance agreements. In our December 2017 report, we reviewed 12 such agreements across the four agencies and found that State and USDA did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance. State has taken corrective action since the grants were awarded. We also found that all four agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements we reviewed. State and HHS both initiated corrective action prior to our review of the grants. The United States provided voluntary contributions to OAS, PAHO, and IICA through project-specific assistance agreements, such as grants and cooperative agreements. According to U.S. agency officials, the organizations’ regional knowledge and technical expertise make them effective implementing partners for projects serving U.S. national interests and priorities throughout the hemisphere. From calendar years 2014 through 2016, the United States provided voluntary contributions totaling about $105 million to the OAS, PAHO, and IICA, as shown in table 2. In addition, agencies may not have all the information they need to make budgetary and programmatic decisions. In our December 2017 report, we recommended that (1) USDA ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and (2) USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of the agreements’ required monitoring activities. Further, if the agencies do not have full documentation of the agreements’ required monitoring activities, they may not be able to effectively manage federally funded projects that support U.S. strategic goals.

For example, USAID said it would issue an agency notice to remind all agreement officers to maintain complete files for each agreement. Chairman Cook, Ranking Member Sires, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions that you may have at this time. In October 2013, the United States enacted the Organization of American States Revitalization and Reform Act of 2013 (Reform Act). The Reform Act directed the Secretary of State to, among other things, submit “a multiyear strategy that…identifies a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms that would lead to an assessed fee structure",
  " time available for other units. Maintenance delays, bad weather, and transit time. Ten of 23 Marine Corps units told us that changes to an amphibious task force and a (2) landing force together with other forces that are trained, organized, and equipped for amphibious operations. The amphibious task force is a group of Navy amphibious ships, most frequently deployed as an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The landing force is a Marine Air- Ground Task Force—which includes certain elements, such as command, aviation, ground, and logistics—embarked aboard the Navy amphibious ships. A Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is the most-commonly deployed Marine Air-Ground Task Force. Together, this amphibious force is referred to as an ARG-MEU. The Navy and Marine Corps have not fully established compatible policies and procedures, such as common training tasks and standards and agreed-upon roles and responsibilities, to ensure their efforts to achieve improved naval integration are consistent and sustained. We also found that some of the Navy and Marine Corps’ systems for managing and conducting integrated training are incompatible, leading to inefficiencies in the process to manage unit-level training events. Leverage resources to maximize training opportunities.

We also found that some of the Navy and Marine Corps’ systems for managing and conducting integrated training are incompatible, leading to inefficiencies in the process to manage unit-level training events. Leverage resources to maximize training opportunities. The services are looking to better leverage available training resources for amphibious operations. However, we identified examples of potential training opportunities during surface warfare tactical training and community relations events where enhancing the services’ collaborative efforts could take greater advantage of available training time for amphibious operations. Mechanisms to monitor results and reinforce accountability. The Navy and Marine Corps do not prioritize all available training resources. For Marine Corps units not scheduled for a MEU deployment, officials described an ad hoc process to allocate any remaining available amphibious ship training time among home- station units. Specifically, officials stated that the current process identifies units that are available for training when an amphibious ship becomes available rather than a process that aligns the next highest- priority units for training with available amphibious ships. The Navy and Marine have not developed mechanisms to monitor and reinforce accountability. The Navy and Marine have not developed mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results in improving naval integration and to align efforts to maximize training opportunities. Service-level strategy documents establish critical tasks to improve naval integration, but do not constitute a process or mechanism to jointly reinforce accountability for their naval integration efforts. In our review, we identified a number of alternatives that could help mitigate the risk to the services’ amphibious capability due to limited training opportunities.",
  "We monitor the progress that Congress and executive branch agencies have made in addressing the issues we identified in each of our last seven annual reports. As shown in table 4, Congress and executive branch agencies have made consistent progress in addressing many of the actions we identified from 2011 to 2017. As of March 2018, 376 (52 percent) of the actions we identified from 2011 to 2017 have been fully addressed.

See our online Action Tracker for the status of all actions. The progress Congress and executive branch agencies have made in addressing our open actions has resulted in $178 billion in financial benefits, including roughly $125 billion in financial benefits from 2010 through 2017, with at least an additional $53 billion in estimated benefits projected to accrue in 2018 or later. Table 5 highlights examples of these results. These financial benefits continue to grow as we identify and document additional agency actions that respond to our recommendations. HHS also operates other public health-related agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. HHS represented about 27 percent of the fiscal year 2017 federal budget, with outlays totaling about $1.2 trillion. As of March 2018, 56 of HHS’s 111 actions remained open. Our work suggests that effectively implementing these actions, including those related to areas listed in table 8, could reduce costs, provide services more efficiently, and yield substantial financial benefits. CMS’s new policy partially responds to a longstanding recommendation we have made to better ensure that valid methods are used to demonstrate budget neutrality.

We anticipate that CMS’s recent actions could potentially reduce the federal government’s liability for Medicaid by billions, or tens of billions, annually. While not all actions result in financial benefits to taxpayers, all of our suggested actions, when implemented, can result in other benefits—for instance, they make government more efficient or eliminate, reduce, or improve",
  "poor” assessments. On the basis of its assessment, the partnership rated the Delta and Suisun Bay ecosystems as being in fair to poor condition and the Bay as healthier. In the upper watershed, progress assessment is tied to entity- and topic- specific plans and is not summarized by any one group or in one report. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

Key federal entities, including Interior and CEQ, have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the San Francisco Bay Delta watershed. Different combinations of federal and nonfederal entities have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the Bay Delta watershed. Different combinations of federal and nonfederal entities work throughout the watershed and its three major geographic areas, which are the San Francisco Bay and its local watershed (Bay), the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), and the upper watershed, which includes California’s Central Valley and the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. See below for a list of federal and nonfederal entities and a brief description of some of their restoration-related roles in the Bay Delta watershed. In the state level, the San Francisco Estuary Institute and the Delta Stewardship Council each maintains a database with information about federal and nonfederal restoration efforts. These plans include goals similar to those outlined in the CCMP or the Delta Plan—such as ecosystem restoration, climate resilience, and other facilities. Several federal agencies have roles related to water quality improvement and ecosystem restoration efforts in the Bay-Delta watershed. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities carry out a wide range of restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities carry out a wide range of restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta. In the Bay, federal and nonfederal entities provide input on developing and revising the CCMP and have integrated goals into the CCMP from their own topic- or entity-specific strategic plans. In addition, since California stopped participating in the originally structured CALFED partnership, funding for ecosystem restoration in the Bay area traditionally has come from a mix of federal and state sources. For example, the entity said a local source that will provide nearly $500 (Recommendation 7) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to CEQ, EPA, OMB, and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, and the Interior.

Dredging businesses work with the California State Water Resources Control Board to help fund the San Francisco Estuary Institute’s water quality monitoring program. Water contractors. In an email from CEQ’s Deputy General Counsel, CEQ provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. In oral comments provided on August 8, 2018, OMB staff suggested some additional language to the report. In oral comments provided on August 8, 2018, OMB staff suggested that OMB should “assess whether to” update OMB’s written guidance for federal and state agencies on submitting data for the budget crosscut reports. Also, according to our analysis of survey responses, 27 of 48 federal and nonfederal entities indicated that it would be very or extremely important to have reports on federal obligations, and 24 of the 48 entities indicated that it would be very or extremely important to have reports on state obligations.

Chairman Meadows, Ranking Member Connolly, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have at this time. If you or your staff have any questions about this testimony, please contact Lori Rectanus, Director, Physical Infrastructure Issues at (202) 512-2834 or rectanusl@gao.gov. Seized items are categorized in SEACATS as either drugs or merchandise. Among the approximately 308,000 seizures, illegal or inadmissible drugs accounted for about 47 percent of total seizures and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. In fiscal years 2012 through 2015, CBP’s seizure data reflect zero seizures of fentanyl, but according to CBP, there may be additional seizures of fentanyl in the United States, and there may be additional seizures of fentanyl in the United States.

In fiscal years 2012 through 2015, CBP’s seizure data reflect zero seizures of fentanyl, but according to CBP, fentanyl seizures would have been captured under other categories in SEACATS. According to CBP, a specific category code for fentanyl was added to SEACATS in fiscal year 2016. SEACATS reflects 53 seizures of fentanyl in fiscal year 2016 via both mail and express cargo. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both USPS and express consignment operators provide items to CBP for inspection. Express consignment operators accept items for delivery to the United States at points of sale in foreign countries and provide EAD prior to the items’ scheduled arrival in the United States. CBP then analyzes the EAD and provides lists of targeted items to express consignment operators. In our report we found that an analysis of the costs associated with planned efforts is particularly critical given USPS reported a net loss of $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2016—its 10th consecutive year of net losses. In light of this situation,",
  ") the Global Development Lab’s (the Lab) programs, funding, and staffing resources. According to USAID documents, the agency seeks to build partnerships that leverage the assets, skills, and resources of the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to deliver sustainable development impact. According to USAID officials, the agency moved a number of the two offices’ core programs and activities, along with staffing functions, to the Lab. To the extent that the Lab used outdated data when generating external reports and budget exercises, it risks reporting incorrect information about non-USAID contributions to Lab awards. As table 5 indicates, the Lab met or exceeded its targets for 20 of its 39 indicators in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. For example, for one indicator— total number of program or policy changes made by public sector, private sector, or other development actors that are influenced by Lab-funded research results or related scientific activities—the Lab reported that it exceeded its target for both fiscal years 2016 and 2017. For another indicator— total number of program or policy changes made by public sector, private sector, or other development actors that are influenced by Lab-funded research results or related scientific activities—the Lab reported that it exceeded its target for both fiscal years 2016 and 2017. For another indicator— total number of program or policy changes made by public sector, private sector, or other development actors that are influenced by Lab-funded research results or related scientific activities—the Lab reported that it exceeded its target for both fiscal years. The Lab’s targets for this indicator for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 were set at 42 and 48, respectively, with reported results of 83 and 84. For another indicator— total dollar value of private and public capital catalyzed for early-stage entrepreneurs as a result of USAID support—the Lab reported it had exceeded its fiscal year 2017 target of $575 million, with an actual result of around $686 million. In addition, the Lab improved its performance for seven indicators, according to its data. For instance, for agency integration indicators—such as the number of operating units that have integrated STIP at the strategic, programmatic, and organizational levels—the Lab went from not meeting its targets in fiscal year 2016 to exceeding its targets in fiscal year 2017. The Lab’s indicator data also show some areas in which the Lab has faced challenges or has not met its targets in fiscal years 2016 and 2017.

The Lab’s indicator data also show some areas in which the Lab has faced challenges or has not met its targets. The Lab’s indicator data also show some areas in which the Lab has faced challenges or has not met its targets. As table 5 shows, the Lab did not meet its targets for 19 of the 39 indicators in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. For example, the Lab did not meet its targets for 19 of the 39 indicators in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Lab did not meet its targets for 19 of the 39 indicators in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. In fiscal years In addition, since fiscal year 2015, the number of direct-hire staff employed by the Lab has decreased. According to Lab officials, because of the technical focus of its programming, the Lab has not been able to staff all authorized positions with direct-hire employees who have the necessary expertise. Instead, the Lab has filled some of these positions with contractors or science fellows. The Lab also uses a variety of other hiring mechanisms, such as the Participating Agency Service Agreement with the Department of Agriculture and the American Association for Advancement of Science fellows, to allow for flexibility and obtain the needed expertise to implement STIP and technical services throughout USAID. Additional findings included the need for Higher Education Solutions Network labs to streamline activities, adjust resource allocations, and increase synergies based on the insights gained through the first 5 years. Global Broadband and Innovations Alliance Performance Evaluation. The evaluation found, among other things, successful outcomes of specific projects focused on sustainably increasing broadband internet connectivity in the developing world. The Lab’s (the Lab’s) activities are funded by the Department of Science, Technology, Innovation, and partnerships (STIP).

  " to increases in the amount of data collected in the field, which is more costly to the Bureau. Contingency allocations increased overall from $1.35 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2017, as the Bureau gained a greater understanding of risks facing the 2020 Census. Increases of $838 million in the Census/Survey Engineering category were due mainly to the cost of an IT contract for integrating decennial survey systems that was not included in the 2015 cost estimate. Bureau officials attribute a decrease of $551 million in estimated costs for Program Management to changes in the categorization of costs associated with risks: In the 2017 version of the estimate, estimated costs related to program risks were allocated to their corresponding WBS element. More generally, factors that contributed to cost fluctuations between the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates include: changes in assumptions for census operations, improved ability to anticipate and quantify risk, an overall increase in IT costs, and more defined contract requirements. Several assumptions for the implementation of the 2020 Census have changed since the 2015 cost estimate. Some assumptions contributing to cost changes, mainly in the Response (the mapping and collecting addresses to frame enumeration activities) and the Assessment (the mapping and collecting addresses to frame enumeration activities) categories, include the following: The Bureau told us it has used our best practices for cost estimation to develop their cost estimate, and will focus on those best practices that require attention moving forward.

Several assumptions for the implementation of the 2020 Census have changed since the 2015 cost estimate. Some assumptions contributing to cost changes, mainly in the Response (related to collecting and processing response data) and Frame (the mapping and collecting addresses to frame enumeration activities) categories, include the following: According to the Bureau’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. The Bureau’s cost estimation team used a software tool to generate the cost estimate. Those characteristics are: Well-documented: An estimate is thoroughly documented, including source data and significance, clearly detailed calculations and results, and explanations of why particular methods and references were chosen. Data can be traced to their source documents. Accurate: An estimate is unbiased, the work is not overly conservative or overly optimistic, and is based on an assessment of most likely costs. Few, if any, mathematical mistakes are present. Credible: Any limitations of the analysis because of uncertainty or bias surrounding data or assumptions are discussed. Major assumptions are varied, and other outcomes are recomputed, to determine how sensitive they are to changes in the assumptions. Risk and uncertainty analysis is performed to determine the level of risk associated with the estimate. The estimate’s results are cross. The Bureau only partially met the criteria for well-documented, as set forth in our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. A cost estimate that does not fully meet the criteria for well-documented cannot be used by management to make informed and effective implementation decisions. The well-documented characteristic comprises five best practices. The Bureau substantially met two out of five best practices (as shown in figure 4). First, the estimate describes in sufficient detail the calculations performed and the estimating methodology used to derive each element’s cost, and the cost estimate had been reviewed by management. Since cost estimates can inform key decisions and budget requests, it is vital that management review and understand how the estimate was developed, including risks associated with the underlying data and methods. The cost estimate only partially met three best practices for the characteristic of being well-documented. In addition, the Bureau added approximately $965 million to the cost estimate to reflect discrete risks outlined in the risk register as well as those associated with (1) variability in self-response rates, (2) variability in self-response rates, (3) the effect of fluctuations in the size and wage rate of the temporary workforce on the cost of field operations, and (4) the potential need to reduce the enumerator-to- manager staffing ratio in case expected efficiencies in field operations are not realized. In addition to these provisions, the Bureau added approximately $965 million to the cost estimate to reflect discrete risks outlined in the risk register as well as those associated with (1) variability in self-response rates, (2) the effect of fluctuations in self-response rates, (3) the effect of fluctuations in self-response rates, and (4) the potential need to reduce the enumerator-to- manager staffing ratio in case expected efficiencies in field operations are not realized.

The military services’ real property efforts to address deficiencies in business systems, processes, and controls through its Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan. The FIAR Plan guidance includes 40 of the data elements required to be reported to OSD and maintained in RPAD within the scope of the effort. As part of the department’s FIAR effort, each of the military services developed individual plans to prepare their management processes, such as their accountability systems and procedures for real property, which would be tested during financial audit. The military services’ real property efforts to address deficiencies in business systems, processes, and controls through its Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan. The FIAR Plan guidance includes 40 of the data elements required to be reported to OSD and maintained in RPAD within the scope of the effort. According to OSD and military service officials, identifying significant data elements could assist with streamlining and prioritization of efforts to improve data quality. In addition, OSD officials agreed that requiring the services to develop and implement corrective action plans would benefit data quality, but stated there are challenges with the verification and validation tool that would need to be addressed to leverage its full potential. By OSD not defining significant data elements and coordinating corrective action plans to remediate discrepancies, the military services may continue to submit information with discrepancies from year to year in some data elements and will miss an opportunity to improve the accuracy of inventory data. We and the military services have identified that real property installation officials do not consistently document or enter physical inventory information into the dataset, although certain data we reviewed improved since fiscal year 2014. Accuracy of data elements and completeness of RPAD are important to OSD, other federal agencies, and Congress because they use this information to determine facility sustainment funding and to understand DOD’s utilization of its real property as a means to budget for required sustainment, restoration, or construction of All facilities are required to have a utilization rate from 0 to 150. Additionally, our analysis showed that the number of facilities OSD did not include in RPAD ranged from about 3,300 facilities (0.5 percent) to 19,400 facilities (2.6 percent) of the facilities reported by the military services and WHS in fiscal years 2014 through 2016. If all of these facilities still existed during those years, the total plant replacement value of the unreported facilities ranged from $3.4 billion to $21.6 billion. OSD and military service officials agreed that accuracy and completeness issues with real property have been a long standing issue, but stated recent audit efforts associated with FIAR should result in some improvements of the data. For example, military service installations officials stated that they are working to reconcile differences between existing real property and information in their data systems to include adding existing assets that are not in the data system and correcting information on disposed assets. Specifically, military service officials stated that they have emphasized conducting timely physical inventories and require installations to report on the currency of their physical inventories. According to officials, when reporting real property to OSD and when OSD consolidates this information into RPAD, assets with significant errors in their records are excluded to improve the accuracy of the information in the data set. The officials explained as the accuracy of the data improves through physical inventories, fewer assets will be excluded in the reporting process, which will improve completeness of RPAD. Specifically, military service officials stated that they have emphasized conducting timely physical inventories and require installations to report on the currency of their data. The official stated that the Marine Corps had made large-scale changes to the records of their housing assets due to a new approach to improve the records of their data elements that",

The use of large patches of carpet in lieu of large patches of carpet has made it very easy and relatively inexpensive to maintain and repair office spaces and courtrooms. Low-maintenance landscaping. Several of the 10 Design Excellence buildings we visited incorporated native flora into the landscape design, which can reduce energy and water costs. For example, officials planted native, drought resistant plants around the First Street Federal Courthouse (Los Angeles, California). Building officials at the Las Cruces U.S. Courthouse (Las Cruces, New Mexico), which is located in a desert environment, also reported most of the native landscape around the courthouse does not require watering. According to our survey respondents—building managers at all 78 Design Excellence buildings included in our review—certain GSA design choices, such as multistory atriums and custom windows, have resulted in variable temperatures and employee discomfort. In addition, GSA has sometimes made design choices in buildings that do not apply to one of the primary functional goals of the Design Excellence Program—to serve as a landmark that positively represents the federal government to the public. As discussed, some design choices in Design Excellence buildings have decreased or increased O&M costs. Since GSA does not consider that some buildings, due to their purpose or location, are unlikely to function as landmarks because they have limited interaction with or limited visibility by the public. Almost all Design Excellence building managers (76 out of 78) reported that certain design choices resulted in increased O&M costs that would not have occurred had that design choice not been selected. Many of these buildings have decreased or increased O&M costs. According to GSA does not systematically share how these types of design choices in Design Excellence buildings have decreased or increased O&M costs. According to GSA does not consider that some buildings, due to their purpose or location, are unlikely to function as landmarks because they have limited interaction with or limited visibility by the public. In this regard, we found that most Design Excellence buildings (66 of 78) are visible and accessible to the general public, i.e., “public-facing”. Many of these buildings have decreased or increased O&M costs. According to GSA does not systematically share how these types of design choices affected O&M costs with other buildings, similar issues could occur in future buildings, similar issues could occur in future buildings. For example, we previously mentioned that building managers indicated that using durable materials, low maintenance landscaping, and energy-efficient lighting can reduce long-term O&M costs. Building managers also reported common issues caused by design choices that resulted in unexpected O&M cost increases. For example, officials noted increased O&M costs associated with separate structures and multistory atriums that were difficult to access for cleaning and repairs. Building managers reported the location of mechanical systems in Design Excellence buildings often led to increased cost. Specifically, building managers reported the location of mechanical systems, which are visible from public streets and people may enter to observe judicial proceedings or conduct personal business. See figure 8 for an example of a Design Excellence courthouse with publicly visible exteriors and interiors. Four serve as office buildings for various federal agencies that are publicly accessible., including procedures, to achieve objectives, as well as on communicating information internally. In addition, we compared GSA’s efforts to consider these costs in the planning and design of Design Excellence buildings to guidance from GSA and the Office of Management and Budget that directs agency officials to consider and strive for the lowest possible costs, including O&M costs, when designing buildings. We also compared GSA’s efforts to consider O&M costs when planning and designing these buildings to pertinent Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government on using complete and relevant information when making decisions and design of design activities, including procedures, to achieve objectives. Without a clear picture of the ongoing costs of these choices, GSA and other stakeholders are missing critical information to better inform the design and construction of new buildings. While GSA has just begun an Operational Excellence initiative to help identify future O&M costs, it is not clear what actions GSA will take to more fully consider O&M costs in Design Excellence buildings during the planning and design stage, GSA and other stakeholders may not have a complete picture of all relevant information necessary to make informed decisions on how to best design future federal buildings. GSA realizes that the focus of Design Excellence projects has been on design and construction, not O&M costs, and, in September 2017, initiated a process, called “Operational Excellence”, to more fully consider O&M costs in Design Excellence buildings during the planning and design stage, GSA and other stakeholders may not have a complete picture of all relevant information necessary to make informed decisions on how to best design future federal buildings.

  " and two air-delivered weapons. NNSA has described this plan as the 3+2 strategy. To undertake this strategy, NNSA has proposed initiating a series of interoperable warhead programs between about 2020 and 2060. NNSA’s plans for the first ballistic missile warhead in the 3+2 strategy—the Interoperable Warhead 1—indicate that, if authorized by Congress, the warhead would cost an estimated $12.4 billion from 2020 to 2041. As we reported in August 2015, NNSA’s Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation told us about a potentially significant production delay if late design changes require Pantex to get new production tools or testers. Late design changes could occur as scientists at the design agencies analyze test results. Under its current program of record, NNSA plans to resume the Interoperable Warhead 1 program in fiscal year 2019. Under its current program of record, NNSA has also begun preliminary planning for Interoperable Warhead 2, Interoperable Warhead 3, and B61-12 bomb’s flight characteristics. The B61-12 bomb has been tested on a variety of test flights, including the B61-12 bomb’s flight characteristics. The B61-12 bomb has been tested on a variety of test flights, including the B61-12 bomb’s flight characteristics. The B61-12 bomb has been tested on a variety of test flights, including the B61-12 bomb’s flight characteristics. Officials from the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation said that although they will not formally assess the B61-12 LEP’s schedule again until the end of phase 6.4 of the program, their informal analysis of NNSA Integrated Master Schedule data as of February 2017 still showed the same rate of activity completion that underpinned the office’s independent cost estimate. For example, these instructions specified that all sites must apply a bottom-up estimating approach that includes detailed quantities and integrated resource-loaded schedules for all work breakdown structure elements under their management. The program office then compiled the site- provided information in a database to arrive at a total program cost. The program office also aggregated schedule information from the sites, which maintain detailed resource-loaded integrated site schedules, to develop an NNSA Integrated Master Schedule. As we previously noted, the program office estimated in October 2016, based on this process, that NNSA’s portion of work on the B61-12 LEP would cost $7.6 billion and that the LEP would be completed in fiscal year 2025, with a first production unit date of March 2020. In contrast, to develop the independent cost estimate, the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation used an estimating method that employed data on the B61-12 LEP’s actual performance, coupled with historical information from the B61-12 LEP. The Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation did not use a method that employed data on the B61-12 LEP’s actual performance, coupled with historical information from the B61-12 LEP. The Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation did not use a method that employed data on the B61-12 LEP’s actual performance. Instead, all of the site contractors developed their cost estimates in then-year dollars and applied varied inflation indexes. Nevertheless, the program incorporated practices that substantially met the criteria for an accurate cost estimate, which we believe contributed to the program’s estimate being reliable. Credible: Substantially met. The B61-12 LEP became the first LEP to undergo a statutorily required independent cost estimate, conducted by the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation. Additionally, a different NNSA office developed a third cost estimate for the program to aid in the preparation of NNSA’s budget materials. Each of these three estimates used a different methodology. NNSA used this third estimate to cross-check overall program costs. The B61-12 LEP became the first LEP to undergo a statutorily required independent cost estimate, conducted by the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation.

  ", plan, and execute material strategies for uranium (including domestic uranium enrichment), plutonium, and tritium. In addition to the general program management challenges highlighted above, we have also reported previously on challenges facing NNSA’s strategic materials programs: In July 2015, we found that NNSA had identified various challenges in its lithium production strategy that may impact its ability to meet demand for lithium in the future. These challenges included insufficient supply of lithium material and constraints facing NNSA’s efforts to replace the aging lithium production facility. We recommended that NNSA objectively consider all alternatives, without preference for a particular solution, as it proceeds with its analysis of alternatives process. NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation but did undertake a formal analysis of alternatives in 2017, according to NNSA officials. In August 2016, we found that NNSA had not documented important requirements for its plutonium program at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. We recommended that, among other things, NNSA should update its program requirements. NNSA outlined actions taken and planned to address this recommendation. NNSA outlined actions taken and planned to address this recommendation. NNSA’s Office of Defense Programs has set program requirements for the strategic materials programs and has established the roles and responsibilities of the programs’ managers. NNSA defined these program requirements in two documents issued in 2016 and 2017. Collectively these documents set documentation requirements for its plutonium program at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. We recommended that, among other things, NNSA should update its program requirements. NNSA outlined actions taken and planned to address this recommendation.

NNSA outlined actions taken and planned to address this recommendation. NNSA’s Office of Defense Programs has set program requirements for the strategic materials programs and has established the roles and responsibilities of the programs’ managers. NNSA defined these program requirements in fiscal year 2018 to carry out its annual activities associated with the management of these strategic materials programs (see table 1). NNSA documents indicate that the agency expects to spend about $7.7 billion over the next 5 years on activities related to managing its strategic materials. This spending, which would represent about 12 percent of the approximately $63 billion NNSA expects to spend on all weapons activities over this same time period, includes: $4.8 billion for costs related to construction of facilities and other capital equipment purchases that will be used to support the strategic materials programs. This instruction outlines a series of requirements that vary based on the categorization—and therefore the rigor—of management applied to a program. Of the four categories outlined in the instruction—Standard Management, Enhanced Management A, Enhanced Management More specifically, according to agency officials: The plutonium sustainment program has had a staff of more than 50 as of January 2014. According to NNSA officials, the additional staff enabled NNSA to conduct more robust oversight of the contractor’s design efforts than was previously possible. Similarly, in 2016, we found that the B61-12 life extension program, the most costly and complex such program undertaken to date, successfully requested that NNSA enlarge its program office staff from 3 to 8 full-time equivalent staff to provide more management capability. However, we found that even with this increase in federal staff, some NNSA and DOD officials said that they believe that NNSA needs two to three times more personnel in the federal program manager’s office to ensure sufficient federal management and oversight. One area that we noted in this review is that with regard to the strategic materials programs, NNSA has not conducted a workforce needs assessment. Strategic materials program officials acknowledged that they had neither specifically assessed the number or skills of staff needed to manage the strategic materials programs, nor did they have current plans to do such an assessment.",
  " costs, including for operations and support for services as well as products. Absent additional direction, contracting officials across DOD may not understand how to consistently apply these criteria when using the LPTA process. We are making the following two recommendations to DOD: The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting, addresses how contracting officials using the LPTA process should apply the Section 813 criterion regarding procurement for goods that are predominantly expendable in nature, nontechnical, or have a short life expectancy or shelf life. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting addresses how contracting officials using the LPTA process should apply the Section 813 criterion regarding full life- cycle costs, including for operations and support as revisions to the DFARS are considered. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in Appendix I, DOD concurred with both of our recommendations. DOD stated that, in addition to its ongoing efforts to update its regulations, a new DFARS Procedures, Guidance and Information case was opened on October 25, 2018 to provide contracting officers with supplemental internal guidance on applying the Section 813 criterion regarding full life- cycle costs, including for operations and support as revisions to the DFARS are considered. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in Appendix I, DOD concurred with both of our recommendations.

Non-cost factors are rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis. The award is made based on the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal submitted to the government. With either the LPTA or the tradeoff process, contracting officials may establish a competitive range and conduct discussions with offerors before selecting an offer for award. By contrast, DOD may elect to use the tradeoff process in acquisitions where the requirement is less definitive, more development work is required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these instances, non-cost factors may play a dominant role in the source selection process. Tradeoffs between price and non-cost factors allow DOD to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. The FAR requires DOD to state in the solicitation whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price. Contracting officials have broad discretion in the selection of the evaluation criteria that will be used in an acquisition. A written acquisition plan generally should include a description of the acquisition’s source selection process and the relationship of the evaluation factors to the acquisition objectives, but the FAR does not explicitly require contracting officials to document the reasons why the specific source selection procedures or evaluation factors were In addition, we found that contracting officials’ reasons for using the LPTA process were generally consistent with the criteria listed in Section 813. We did not make recommendations to DOD in this report. Based upon the results of our generalizable sample, we estimate that about 26 percent of contracts and orders competitively awarded by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DLA valued at $5 million and above in fiscal year 2017 used the LPTA process. Table 1 shows the number and percentage of contracts and orders in our sample that we estimate to have used the LPTA process. We reviewed the 46 contracts and orders for which the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DLA used the LPTA process and found that 20 were for products and 26 for services. Within this sample, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DLA bought a variety of products and services (see figure 2). Contracting officials associated with the 14 contracts and orders we selected used the LPTA process, in part, because they determined there was no tradeoff available or determined there was a low risk of contractor failure because the contracting office was not willing to pay for additional services beyond the minimum requirements. Contracting officials also determined there was a low risk of contractor failure because they were placing an order under a multiple-award IDIQ contract and all contract holders were pre-qualified to perform the work. The Air Force contracting officials stated the requirements were well-defined, as the services have been provided by a contractor for a long time and were well understood. Further, the officials stated they confirmed that the requiring office was not willing to pay for the LPTA process. In this sample, we reviewed the 46 contracts and orders for which the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DLA used the LPTA process and found that 20 were for products and 26 for services.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. To examine the active component’s military construction (MILCON) obligations and expended balances, we reviewed MILCON appropriations found in appropriations acts, including accompanying explanatory statements and conference committee reports from fiscal year 2005 through 2016. Further, we analyzed the obligation and disbursement data of the active component’s MILCON accounts, appropriation status reports, bid savings reports, as well as annual reports from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We also collected and compared project data from each of the active component’s MILCON accounts, including accompanying explanatory statements and conference committee reports from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016. We collected and compared project data from each of the active component’s MILCON accounts, including accompanying explanatory statements and conference committee reports from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016. We collected and compared project data from each of the active component’s MILCON accounts, including accompanying explanatory statements and conference committee reports from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016. In addition, we compared the initial estimate as shown on the Form 1391—the form DOD uses to submit requirements and justifications in support of its funding requests to Congress—with the contract award amount and analyzed any differences between the two. To examine the amount of MILCON reprogramming during fiscal years 2010 and 2016 by the active component, we reviewed DOD’s requests to Congress to reprogram MILCON funds from one project to another. We calculated the total number of times such requests were made and the dollar amounts for fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016. We selected this time frame because the reprogramming requests were readily available from DOD. We selected this time frame because the reprogramming requests were readily available from DOD. These best practices can be used to assist federal agencies in developing reliable cost estimates and also as a tool for evaluating existing cost estimating procedures. To develop the Cost Guide, our cost experts assessed measures applied by cost estimating organizations throughout the federal government and industry and considered best practices for the development of reliable cost estimates. Skipping or not considering any step of the 12-step cost estimating process, especially for high-value projects such as those in our case studies, increases the risk that cost estimates may use improper assumptions, lack appropriate definition, or be otherwise unreliable. Without improving the Unified Facilities Criteria with respect to cost estimating processes, DOD and the services will not be positioned well to provide reliable cost estimates to DOD and congressional decision- makers. Each year DOD receives billions of dollars in MILCON appropriations to use for projects in the United States and overseas. The quality of project cost estimates are of great importance since those estimates are the basis for DOD’s requests for appropriations. We collected and analyzed data for fiscal years 2005 through 2016 on the active component MILCON appropriations, obligations, and disbursements and we collected reprogramming data for We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to March 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In this appendix we provide the supporting details on the active component’s unobligated and unexpended balances of military construction (MILCON) appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. As seen in table 3, for any given year there are typically hundreds of millions of dollars reprogrammed. There are generally multiple active or canceled projects that result in cost savings, which may be used to fund authorized but not specifically funded projects. Below are three examples where the active component funded MILCON projects with amounts reprogrammed from other projects: Repair Shop at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. This is an Air Force project to construct a pacific air resiliency low observable/corrosion control/composite repair shop in Guam. It is an authorized project that did not receive specific funding during the appropriation process but was fully funded by reprogrammed cost savings from active construction projects. This is an Air Force project to construct a pacific air resiliency low observable/corrosion control/composite repair shop in Guam. It is an authorized project that did not receive specific funding during the appropriation process but was fully funded by reprogrammed cost savings from active construction projects. Congress authorized $34.4 million for the repair shop. Congress authorized $34.4 million for the repair shop in fiscal year 2015; however, no funds were specifically appropriated for the project.

  "-payer rates were lower than Medicare’s 2017 national limitation amounts for 88 percent of tests, we estimated the total Medicare expenditures based on the 2018 CLFS would likely increase by 3 percent ($225 million overall) compared to 2016 expenditures, assuming test utilization remained at 2016 levels. This increase in estimated expenditures is due, in part, to CMS’s use of above-average payment rates for panel tests. CMS officials told us they are exploring alternative approaches that could limit increases to Medicare expenditures but had not yet determined what additional legal authority would be needed, if any, and did not know when CMS would make this determination. Agency officials told us that CMS has taken initial steps to monitor unbundling and explore possible responses, including the following: Monitoring unbundling: CMS has begun monitoring changes in panel test utilization, payment rates, and expenditures associated with its implementation of PAMA, according to officials. For example, CMS officials told us that preliminary data indicated that Medicare payments for individual component tests of panel tests has increased substantially in 2018, but, as of July 2018, it was too early to draw conclusions from these data because laboratories have up to one year to submit claims for tests. Collecting input on alternatives: In 2016, a subcommittee of an advisory panel that CMS established reviewed Medicare’s use of bundled payment rates for panel tests and published different approaches for CMS to consider implementing in combination with other changes to implement PAMA. However, CMS officials told us that preliminary data indicated that Medicare payments for individual component tests of panel tests has increased substantially in 2018, but, as of July 2018, it was too early to draw conclusions from these data because laboratories have up to one year to submit claims for tests. Collecting input on alternatives: In 2016, a subcommittee of an advisory panel that CMS established reviewed Medicare’s use of bundled payment rates for panel tests and published different approaches for CMS to consider implementing in combination with other changes to implement PAMA. However, prior to 2018, some payment rates were commonly lower than the national limitation amounts because they were composed of at least 2 of 23 distinct component tests. Additionally, there are 7 specific combinations of these 23 component tests that are commonly used and have their own billing code. Prior to 2018, Medicare paid for both types of panel tests (those without or with a billing code) using a bundled rate based on the number of tests performed, with modest payment increases for each additional test conducted. Specifically, in 2017, Medicare rates for laboratory tests were 18 percent to 30 percent higher than rates paid by certain insurers under health benefits plans for federal employees. Definition of Applicable Laboratories Required to Report Private-Payer Data to CMS CMS defined applicable laboratories as those meeting four criteria: (1) they met the definition of laboratory under regulations implementing the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988; (2) they billed Medicare Part B under their own Medicare billing number, also called the national provider identifier; (3) the payment rate was the same if laboratories used the associated billing code for the panel test or listed each of the component tests separately. After PAMA’s implementation in 2018, the 57 separate fee schedules for Due to CMS’s 2017 national limitation amounts, CMS published Medicare rates for these tests for 2018 through 2020 that were reduced by only 10 percent per year as a result of this limit. For example, a hypothetical laboratory test with a 2017 CLFS national limitation amount of $10.00 and a median private-payer rate of $7.00 would result in CLFS rates of $9.00 in 2018, $8.10 in 2019, and $7.29 in 2020. Changes to median private-payer rates due to collecting more complete data or eliminating inaccurate data would have no effect on Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020 for this hypothetical test if they resulted in new median rates of $7.29 or less. Our analysis of the potential effects that collecting data from additional laboratories could have had on Medicare payment rates and expenditures found that the effect of CMS not collecting complete data would likely have been greater absent PAMA’s limits on annual reductions to Medicare payment rates. As a result, CMS may face challenges setting accurate Medicare rates if it does not collect complete data from all laboratories required to report in the future when PAMA allows for greater annual payment-rate reductions. In general, the median payments rates, weighted for volume, that CMS calculated were lower than Medicare’s previous payment rates for panel tests. According to our analysis, these new payment rates served as the single, national payment rate for individual laboratory tests. These payment rates were also used for the individual, component tests that make up panel tests and were used when laboratories billed Medicare for panel tests in 2018, $7.00 in 2018, $8.10 in 2019, and $7.29 in 2020. Our analysis of PAMA’s provision directing CMS to phase in payment-rate reductions to Medicare payment rates and expenditures found that the effect of CMS may have been greater absent PAMA’s limits on annual reductions to Medicare",
  "IRS authenticates taxpayers to provide the agency with the appropriate level of assurance is consistent with federal standards for internal control and IRS’s Roadmap. Standards for Internal Control notes that agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks, as well as assess whether risk response actions sufficiently reduce risk to an acceptable level. Further, one of IRS’s initiatives in its Roadmap is to strengthen e-authentication and ensure it is in compliance with federal regulations, which includes guidance from NIST. Developing a plan that includes timelines with specific milestones and resource needs to implement the new NIST guidance is consistent with leading practices for effective planning and management. In early 2017, IRS conducted a 2- day, internal, scenario-based workshop to assess risks and impacts and to identify gaps for TPP authentication. In the workshop participants identified a number of potential enhancements to IRS’s authentication processes. In the workshop participants identified a number of potential enhancements to IRS’s authentication processes. In the workshop participants identified a number of potential enhancements to IRS’s authentication processes. In the workshop participants identified a number of potential enhancements to IRS’s authentication processes. In the workshop participants identified a number of potential enhancements to IRS’s authentication processes. In its written comments, IRS noted that its ability to complete these efforts will depend on the availability of resources. As noted throughout our report, we recognize the challenge of balancing competing IT priorities and limited resources, but given the importance of implementing authentication efforts consistent with NIST’s guidance, we continue to believe it should be a high priority. Additionally, in our prior work on the Government Performance and Results Act, we found that developing and using specific milestones and timelines to guide and gauge progress toward achieving an agency’s desired result is a leading practice for effective strategic planning and management. In its written comments, IRS noted that its ability to complete these efforts will depend on the availability of resources. Further, while IRS has developed a business process that would help the agency prioritize initiatives, the process has not been fully implemented. In December 2016, we recommended that IRS estimate and document the costs, benefits, and risks of possible options for taxpayer authentication, in accordance with OMB and NIST guidance. Consistent with our recommendation and its Roadmap, IRS developed a process to assess the costs, benefits, and risks of current and potential authentication tools. However, without clear plans, timelines, and milestones for performing this work, IRS may not be positioned to address the most vulnerable areas in a timely manner. In May 2017, IRS implemented its business decision model to analyze and improve its online taxpayer authentication services and provided us with results from an analysis for implementing a text-to-voice functionality for IRS’s Secure Access online authentication platform. This function would allow taxpayers the option of receiving an automated voice code for authentication on a verified landline (instead of a text message on a mobile phone). As a result of this analysis, IRS approved the proposal to implement this tool. However, in December 2017, IRS officials stated that the text-to-voice tool is not moving forward because of other competing IT improvements and funding constraints. Further, IRS’s planning documents have noted a commitment to identify and leverage authentication best practices from outside organizations to protect taxpayers from potential fraud. IRS has developed a process to assess the costs, benefits, and risks of current and potential authentication services. We spoke with officials from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and representatives from the State of Alabama’s Department of Revenue, both of which are currently using such services. Further, representatives from industry and financial institutions and government officials with whom we spoke advocated a layered approach to authentication that relies on multiple strategies and sources of information, while giving taxpayers options for further protecting their information. Based on our discussions with representatives from industry and state departments of revenue and government officials, some options IRS could consider include the following: Expanding existing IRS services to further protect taxpayers. As discussed earlier, IRS’s online account offers taxpayers several services, including the ability to set up a payment plan and make payments to IRS and view their tax history. In fiscal year 2017, about 808,000 taxpayers created online accounts, and IRS expects this number to grow. IRS’s Roadmap has identified enhancing taxpayer assurance by expanding authentication, such as generating and sending event-driven notifications to taxpayers to help IRS authenticate returns, which could help IRS quickly validate legitimate returns. With this option, IRS may be able to further protect taxpayers from IDT refund fraud. IRS could partner with organizations it trusts that are accessible to taxpayers and enable the partners to identity-proof and authenticate taxpayers. IRS officials also noted that when a taxpayer contacts IRS about TPP authentication, they may want to discuss multiple issues. In these cases, the CSR may choose to record information on another issue instead of the authentication outcome. In the context of TPP, IRS officials stated that CSRs use the notes field to record, for example, the reason why the taxpayer failed the authentication process, and transmit the authentication",
  "), and nonresponse follow-up. To support its 2018 End-to-End Test, the Bureau plans to deploy and use 43 systems incrementally to support nine operations from December 2016 through the end of the test in April 2019. These nine operations are: (1) in-office address canvassing, (2) recruiting staff for address canvassing, (3) training for address canvassing, (4) in-field address canvassing, (5) recruiting staff for field enumeration, (6) training for field enumeration, (7) self-response (i.e., Internet, phone, or paper), and (8) tabulation and dissemination. Appendix I includes additional details about the 43 systems, the operation or operations they support, and key deployment dates. The Bureau has modified the scope to also include assisting with operational testing activities, conducting performance testing for two Internet self-response systems, and technical support for the implementation of the paper data capture system. However, our ongoing work has indicated that the Bureau is facing staffing challenges that could impact its ability to manage and oversee the technical integration contractor. Specifically, the Bureau is managing the integration contractor through a government program management office, but this office is still filling vacancies. Appendix I includes additional details about the 43 systems, the operation or operations they support, and key deployment dates. The four innovation areas the Bureau plans for 2020 show promise for a more cost-effective head count (see table 1). However, the innovations also introduce new risks, in part, because they include new procedures and technology that have not been used extensively in earlier decennials, if at all. Our prior work has shown the importance of the Bureau conducting a robust testing program, including the 2018 End-to-End Test.

Our prior work has shown the importance of the Bureau conducting a robust testing program, including the 2018 End-to-End Test. The Bureau faces challenges in reporting and controlling IT cost growth. In April 2017, the Bureau briefed us on its efforts to estimate the costs for the 2020 Census, during which it presented IT costs of about $2.4 billion from fiscal years 2018 through 2021. Based on this information and other corroborating IT contract information provided by the Bureau, we testified in May 2017 that the Bureau had identified at least $2 billion in IT costs. However, in June 2017, Bureau officials in the 2020 Census Directorate told us that the data they provided in April 2017 did not reflect all IT costs. When the census misses a person who should have been included, it results in an undercount; conversely, an overcount occurs when an individual is counted more than once. Such errors are particularly problematic because of their impact on various subgroups. In May 2017, the Bureau scaled back the operational scope of the 2018 End-to-End and, of the three planned test sites, only the Rhode Island site would fully implement the 2018 End- to-End Test. The For example, we were told by the Bureau supervisors that described certain areas as dead spots where Internet and cell phone service were not available. We also were told by those same supervisors that only certain cell service providers worked in certain areas. In order to access the Internet or cell service in those areas, census workers sometimes needed to drive several miles. In our June 2016 report on the Bureau’s life-cycle cost estimate we made several recommendations with which the Bureau agreed. We will continue to monitor the Bureau’s efforts to address these recommendations. In conclusion, the Bureau has made progress in revamping its approach to the census and testing the new design. However, it faces considerable challenges and uncertainties in (1) implementing the cost-saving innovations; (2) managing the development and security of key IT systems; and (3) developing a quality cost estimate for the 2020 Census. We have ongoing work that is reviewing the Bureau’s efforts to address these challenges. We have ongoing work that is reviewing the extent to which the Bureau’s approach to the 2020 Census meets the specific requirements of the NIST guidance. We will continue to assess the Bureau’s efforts to conduct a cost-effective enumeration and look forward to keeping Congress informed of the Bureau’s progress. We reported in June 2016 that the estimate partially met best practices for this characteristic, in part because we could not independently verify the calculations the Bureau used within its cost model, which the Bureau did not have documented or explained outside its cost model. Well-documented. Cost estimates are considered valid if they are well-documented. Cost estimates are considered valid if they are well-documented to the Bureau’s efforts to address.",
  ". Initiatives Focused on Medicare-Medicaid Beneficiaries. This category includes models focused on better serving individuals eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare in a cost-effective manner. These requirements include: consulting with representatives of relevant federal agencies, as well as clinical and analytical experts in medicine or health care management, when carrying out its duties as described in the law; ensuring models address deficits in care that have led to poor clinical outcomes or potentially avoidable spending; making no less than $25 million of the Innovation Center’s dedicated funding available for model design, implementation, and evaluation each fiscal year starting in 2011. Initiatives to Speed the Adoption of Best Practices. This category includes models in which the Innovation Center collaborates with health care providers, federal agencies, and other stakeholders to test ways of disseminating evidence-based best practices that improve Medicare spending and quality of care for beneficiaries. Primary Care Transformation. This category includes models that use advanced primary care practices—also called “medical homes”— to emphasize prevention, health information technology, care coordination, and shared decision-making among patients and their providers. For certain categories, the Innovation Center assigns primary responsibility for developing and implementing models to a single model group; for some other categories, the responsibility is shared across different groups. For example, the center assigned responsibility for models in the ACO and the Primary Care Transformation categories to the Seamless Care Model Group, whereas the responsibility for models in the Initiatives to Accelerate the Development and Testing of New Payment and Service Delivery Models categories were assigned across all four model groups. To assess is own performance, the Innovation Center established three center-wide performance goals and related measures. Goal 1: Reduce the growth of healthcare costs while promoting better health and health care quality through delivery system reform. This goal has three performance measures that focus on ACOs. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7114 or kingk@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. This goal has three performance measures that focus on ACOs. For example, the center assigned responsibility for models in the ACO and the Primary Care Transformation categories to the Seamless Care Model Group, whereas the responsibility for models in the Initiatives to Accelerate the Development and Testing of New Payment and Service Delivery Models categories were assigned across all four model groups. Appendix II provides a summary of the number of models organized under each category and a description of each model. As of March 1, 2018, the Innovation Center had implemented 37 models under section 1115A of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission as administrative barriers to the timely completion of demonstrations are inapplicable. Specifically, section 1115A provides the following: HHS cannot require that an Innovation Center model initially be budget neutral—that is, designed so that estimated federal expenditures under the model are In contrast, no evaluations of the CJR model have been publicly released. The Innovation Center has also used the results from evaluations as one way to improve the operational and participant support for new models. According to officials, evaluations have helped them identify lessons learned regarding support systems, such as which types of systems work well with which types of models, and then the center incorporated those lessons when designing the systems for new models. For example, officials noted that the experience with the learning system from the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) models informed the learning system for the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model. The lessons learned helped the Innovation Center better identify where participants would need additional support and the learning activities—such as webinars and implementation guides—to provide the needed support during the early stages of model implementation. Innovation Center officials told us that these lessons from evaluations helped ensure that each successive model built upon the collective experience of models implemented by the center. According to officials, these changes include adjustments to the delivery and payment approaches, such as refining the target population, broadening the geographic focus, and refinements of spending calculations. According to officials, total annual obligations increased steadily from approximately $95 million in fiscal year 2011 to more than $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015, but decreased slightly in fiscal year 2016. (See fig. 4) Most of these total obligations were for model programs, which followed a similar pattern, increasing from $51 million in 2011 to about $51 million in 2011 to about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015, but decreased slightly in fiscal year 2016. In addition, officials told us that the Innovation Center did not meet the requirement to provide additional support during the early stages of model implementation. Innovation Center officials told us that these lessons from evaluations helped ensure that each successive model built upon the collective experience of models implemented by the center did not",
  " has concerns with GAO’s alternative interpretations of law and that GAO’s findings and conclusions are rooted in an incorrect legal interpretation of OMB’s annual appropriation. Specifically, it stated that GAO considers reporting requirements specific to an annual appropriation to apply for all future annual appropriations. However, OMB’s characterization is incorrect, as we did not assert this legal conclusion. As stated in our report, in the explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Congress directed OMB to identify the 10 highest priority IT investment programs (referred to in our report as the top 10 high priority programs) that are under development across federal agencies and report on their status each quarter. Subsequently, the explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, directed USDS to provide a quarterly status report on, among other things, current USDS projects, including the top 10 high priority programs. Our report does not conclude that the language of either explanatory statement establishes a legally binding requirement, whether applicable only to the subject fiscal year or beyond. A report issued by the Federal CIO Council in January 2017, entitled The State of Federal Information Technology, noted that continued identification and reporting on the top 10 high priority programs, and not just USDS projects, would help to enhance congressional oversight and current administration IT governance entities’ efforts. In April 2017, OMB reported that it had not led a TechStat review since 2015. A report issued by the Federal CIO Council in January 2017, entitled The State of Federal Information Technology, noted that continued identification and reporting on the top 10 high priority programs, and not just USDS projects, would help to enhance congressional oversight. Our analysis determined that four of the projects identified in USDS’s reports were among the high priority programs that OMB’s E-Gov office had identified in its June 2015 and June 2016 reports to Congress. These projects were Healthcare.Gov, Disability Claim Processing, modernizing the immigration system at the Department of Homeland Security, and improving the Visa program at the Department of State. However, USDS’s report does not specify this or provide an update on the status of the other high priority programs. USDS staff stated that they did not address all of the top 10 high priority programs because, as stated earlier in this report, OMB launched the PortfolioStat initiative, which required agencies to conduct an annual, agency-wide portfolio review to, among other things, reduce commodity IT spending and demonstrate how their investments aligned with the agency’s mission and business functions. These reviews were to be held between the Federal CIO and agency leadership. In 2014 and 2015, OMB’s PortfolioStat guidance also called for it and agencies to identify high impact IT programs that merited additional support and oversight by OMB and/or agency leadership, and for these programs to be discussed during a PortfolioStat session. The 2015 guidance also changed the frequency of the PortfolioStat sessions from annually to quarterly, and the level of participation Specifically, staff in the E-Gov office, including the Unit Chief for the Agency Oversight and Implementation team, stated that they chose the top 10 programs from a list of high impact programs that OMB separately maintains. They added that their approach was not guided by any documented procedures or scoring techniques to distinguish the programs. Analysts in the E-Gov office told us that, to identify the high impact programs from which the top 10 high priority programs were selected, OMB is likely to miss significant opportunities to improve accountability for and achieve positive results from the federal government’s IT investments. OMB issued two reports on the high priority programs—one in 2015 and another in 2016. While these reports provided the requested information they were not issued quarterly. According to the E-Gov staff, OMB was not able to report quarterly on the programs because of other competing reporting requirements, limited resources available to draft the report, and the amount of time it takes to get its reports fully reviewed. Moreover, the staff stated that OMB sought input from officials of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the 24 Chief Financial Officers of the",
  "L’s in-house R&D work was outside of the scope of our review. To assess the reliability of the funding data, as well as the specific project information for the 794 R&D projects, we interviewed data specialists at DOE Headquarters, FE, and NETL and reviewed DOE internal guidance for the maintenance of agency data. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also reviewed DOE websites and documentation, including fact sheets, and interviewed officials from FE and NETL. To characterize the kinds of groups that received advanced fossil energy R&D funding, we developed the following definitions for each recipient: University: any institution of higher education, such as a public or non-profit private college, junior college, or university. Federal financial assistance means assistance that non-federal entities receive or administer in the form of grants, property, cooperative agreements, food commodities, direct appropriations, or other assistance, and can also include loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance, depending on the context, but does not include amounts received as reimbursement for services rendered to individuals in accordance with OMB- issued guidance. 2 C.F.R. § 200.40. See also 31 U.S.C. § 7501(5). A grant agreement is generally defined as a legal instrument of financial assistance between a federal awarding agency and a non-federal entity that is used to transfer anything of value from the federal awarding agency to the non-federal entity, but does not include amounts received as reimbursement for services rendered to individuals in accordance with OMB- issued guidance. 2 C.F.R. § 200.40. See also 31 U.S.C. § 7501(5). A grant agreement is generally defined as a legal instrument of financial assistance between a federal awarding agency and a non-federal entity. These 794 projects included 9 later-stage large demonstration projects and 785 other advanced fossil energy R&D projects. DOE provided $1.12 billion in funding to nine large projects aimed at demonstrating the commercial viability of CCS technologies. DOE provided $1.54 billion in funding to 785 other R&D projects for both coal and oil and gas technologies, mostly to universities and industry, located in 46 states and the District of Columbia. For nine large demonstration projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017, DOE provided $1.12 billion in funding. These projects received that funding from appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) and supported efforts to reduce the financial and technical risks of commercial CCS, according to a 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service. Six demonstration projects researched CCS technologies using coal, while three used other fuels, namely methane, ethanol, and petcoke. Recipients were generally required to provide a certain percentage of the cost of each R&D project, called cost share. Specifically, to receive funding, recipients of funding for the nine large demonstration projects agreed to pay at least $610 million in cost share for the demonstration projects. Three of those demonstration projects remained active at the For these 785 R&D projects—DOE had not guaranteed any loans for advanced fossil energy as of August 2018. Specifically, the 2006 and 2008 advanced fossil energy solicitations were for projects that involved coal-based power generation and that would incorporate CCS, coal gasification, or other beneficial uses of carbon, among other things. However, neither solicitation resulted in any loan guarantees, in part because during this timeframe of the late 2000s, natural gas prices fell, causing a shift in the market, which led to such coal-related projects no longer being economically competitive, according to DOE officials. According to the fiscal year 2014 solicitation, applicants could use any fossil fuel—including coal, oil, or natural gas—that would reduce, avoid, or sequester greenhouse gases. In response to the 2014 advanced fossil energy solicitation, DOE officials told us that DOE had received 19 applications total. According to DOE officials: Five fossil energy applicants were actively moving through the process of review as of August 2018. For example, in January 2018, one applicant issued a press release stating that it was pursuing a $1.9 billion loan guarantee to support the development of infrastructure for a proposed underground storage facility for natural gas liquids and intermediates.

  "and their contractor employees. To further assess internal communication, we reviewed relevant documentation, including guidance, and conducted interviews with procurement officials, NASA’s Office of General Counsel, and Chief Counsels at JSC, NSSC, and Marshall Space Flight Center. To assess the extent to which NASA communicated the applicable whistleblower reprisal protections with grantees, we reviewed a non- generalizable sample of grants awarded by NASA in fiscal year 2016 to determine whether NASA grants included a mechanism notifying grantees of their employees’ whistleblower rights and reprisal protections. We used FPDS-NG to identify a non-generalizable random sample of grants awarded by NASA in fiscal year 2016 to determine whether NASA grants included a mechanism notifying grantees of their employees’ whistleblower rights and reprisal protections. We used FPDS-NG to identify a non-generalizable random sample of grants awarded by NASA in fiscal year 2016 to determine whether NASA grants included a mechanism notifying grantees of their employees’ whistleblower rights and reprisal protections. We used FPDS-NG to identify a non-generalizable random sample of 10 grants awarded by NASA in fiscal year 2016 for review to determine whether any of the selected grants included a mechanism to communicate whistleblower reprisal protections to grantee employees. Additionally, we reviewed relevant documentation to assess the extent to which the NASA OIG was conducting investigations and communicating findings to the NASA Administrator within required time frames. To determine the extent NASA OIG developed guidance, we interviewed or obtained written answers from OIG officials about their processes and practices for investigating whistleblower reprisal complaints. We reviewed the guidance and training and other materials that NASA OIG uses to implement whistleblower protection investigations. We also visited Johnson Space Center (JSC)—selected because it had the highest number of reprisal cases from 2008 through 2017—to discuss policies and procedures specific to that center with OIG investigators and the OIG program manager for whistleblower protections. See table 1 for detailed description of the 2008, 2013, and 2014 amendments of the statute. Under the current statute, the NASA Office of Inspector General and Administrator have different responsibilities. Since the 2014 amendments, contractor, subcontractor, grantee, and subgrantee employees are protected from reprisal if they disclose to certain persons or bodies information they reasonably believe is evidence of gross mismanagement of a federal contract or grant, a gross waste of federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a federal contract or grant, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a federal contract or grant. Additionally, contractor employees may make whistleblower disclosures to several entities, including a management official at the contractor. Figure 1 depicts the official from Office of General Counsel’s Office of General Counsel’s Office of General Counsel’s Office of General Counsel, which he said is a key contributor for the office’s inability to meet the 30-day timeline to issue an order of final determination of reprisal. Despite acknowledging these challenges, the Administrator does not have a formal process or criteria to monitor and evaluate the way the office handles issuing an order of final determination of reprisal. Because the Administrator took longer than 30 days to respond to all reprisal complaints, including one where the Office of General Counsel failed to provide evidence that the Administrator responded at all, there may be the unintended consequence of disincentivizing future whistleblowers from making disclosures of reprisal in 30 days—the required review period specified by statute. We reviewed the Administrator’s documentation on the final disposition of reprisal. Internal controls require that management should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system, evaluate the results, and take appropriate action to address issues on a timely basis.

  "orated rate thereafter. The wardrobe, lease penalty, and miscellaneous expense types are the same for the home service transfer as for the foreign service transfer. The separate maintenance allowance (SMA) defrays the additional expense of maintaining family members at another location (1) because of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at the overseas post of assignment, (2) for the convenience of the U.S. government, or (3) because of special needs or hardships involving the employee or a family member. There are three types—involuntary, voluntary, and transitional. Involuntary SMA is provided when State determines that there is an adverse, dangerous, or notably unhealthful condition that should exclude family members from accompanying employees at a post. The annual rate is based on family size ranging from $6,800 for one child only to $23,000 for an adult and four or more family members. Voluntary SMA can be authorized based on an employee’s request for special needs or hardship at posts for reasons including, but not limited to, career, health, educational, or family considerations. The annual rate is based on family size, ranging from $5,300 for one child only to $18,000 for an adult and four or more family members. Voluntary SMA can be authorized based on an employee’s request for special needs or hardship at posts for reasons including, but not limited to, career, health, educational, or family considerations. The annual rate is based on family size, ranging from $5,300 for one child only to $23,000 for an adult and four or more family members. Voluntary SMA can be authorized based on an employee’s request for special needs or hardship at posts for reasons including, but not limited to, career, health, educational, or family considerations. The annual rate is based on family size, ranging from $5,300 for one child only to $18,000 for an adult and four or more family members. Transitional SMA is granted for a limited time after a post’s evacuation status changes or in connection with the beginning or end of an unaccompanied posting. It is paid at a daily rate based on the number of eligible family members, the standard continental U.S. per diem rate, and the amount of time the employee receives the allowance. The education allowance defrays extraordinary and necessary costs, not otherwise compensated for, to obtain adequate elementary and secondary education for dependent children at overseas posts that would normally be free of charge in the United States. State determines the approved rate based on allowable education expenses for (1) a school at the post, (2) a school away from the post, (3) home schooling / private instruction, or (4) home schooling / private instruction, or (5) home schooling / private instruction, or (6) home schooling / private instruction, or (7) home schooling / private instruction, or (8) home schooling / private instruction, or (9) home schooling / home schooling / private instruction, or (10) home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / private instruction, or (10) home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / private instruction, or ( 11) home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / private instruction, or ( 11) home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / home schooling / private instruction. According to State officials, while most overseas posts provide government-leased or owned housing for employees and their families at no cost to the employee, employees can receive the following three allowances to assist with housing costs: The living quarters allowance defrays the annual cost of suitable, adequate living quarters for the employee and his or her family at an overseas post where government-leased or government-owned housing is not provided. The extraordinary quarters allowance defrays the annual cost of suitable, adequate living quarters for the employee and his or her family at an overseas post where government-leased or government-owned housing is not provided. Rates vary by post and are designed to substantially cover the average employee’s costs for rent, utilities, required taxes levied by the local government, and other allowable expenses. According to State officials, while most posts provide government housing, employees assigned to posts in Canada and Bern, Switzerland, for example, primarily rely on the rental market. The temporary quarters subsistence allowance assists with the reasonable cost of temporary lodging, meals, and laundry in a foreign area when an employee first arrives at a new post. The temporary quarters allowance assists with the reasonable cost of temporary lodging, meals, and laundry in a foreign area when an employee first arrives at a new post and permanent quarters are not yet available, or when an employee is getting ready to depart the overseas post permanently and must vacate residential quarters. The rate is based on the per diem at post, the size of an employee’s family, and the amount of time the employee receives the allowance. Employees cannot receive",
  " questions about whether the program is being used as intended. Patent Trial and Appeal Board officials are aware of concerns over multiple petitions and recently concluded a study about the prevalence of such practices in relation to all three types of proceedings created by the AIA. The board found that among the 359 patents challenged under the CBM program, 73.3 percent were challenged once and 18.4 percent were challenged twice during the 5- year period we reviewed. The board’s website, including the frequently-asked-questions pages, is updated with information relevant to stakeholders, including stakeholder concerns. For example, written stakeholder comments submitted in response to a proposed rulemaking are posted on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s website for public viewing. Stakeholders we interviewed generally agreed that the CBM program has reduced litigation, and many said there is value in maintaining some aspects of the program. The Director of USPTO should develop guidance, such as documented procedures, for judges reviewing the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decisions and the processes that led to the decisions. The Director of USPTO should develop guidance, such as documented procedures, for judges reviewing the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decisions and the processes that led to the decisions. The Director of USPTO should develop guidance, such as documented procedures, for judges reviewing the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decisions and the processes that led to the decisions. The board has made several changes to policies and procedures based on stakeholder feedback gathered through these mechanisms. For example, after the Patent Trial and Appeal Board had been operational for about 18 months, it conducted a series of eight roundtables in April and May of 2014 at locations around the country to publicly share information concerning trial proceedings, to obtain public feedback on these proceedings, and to launch the process of revisiting its trial rules and trial practice guide. The board has made several changes to policies and procedures based on stakeholder feedback gathered through these mechanisms. In other instances, petitioners first sought CBM review and, when that was unsuccessful, filed an inter partes review. In these cases, petitioners may initially be seeking CBM review and, when that was unsuccessful, filed an inter partes review. In these cases, petitioners may initially be seeking CBM review because of the additional grounds available for challenging the patents, and then turning to the inter partes review program if the CBM challenge proves unsuccessful. The AIA in 2011 created the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and stated any references in federal law to USPTO’s then-existing Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences be deemed to refer to the new board. In 2014, however, the Supreme Court effectively limited the patentability of some business methods by ruling in Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l that using a generic computer to implement an abstract idea is not patentable. Traditionally, economic theory has held that intellectual property rights, such as those conferred by patents, can help encourage innovation and stimulate economic growth. Exclusive rights provided by patents, for example, can help patent innovation and stimulate economic growth. In addition, the board has used the “broadest reasonable construction” standard—meaning the ordinary meaning that someone skilled in the art would reach—to define the language of the claims during post-grant review as a reasonable exercise of the board’s rulemaking authority. In addition, a few stakeholders suggested that subject matter eligibility challenges should be available for patents in all areas of technology. However, our analysis of RPX litigation data from 2007 to 2017 did not support these assertions. Patent litigation data did not show an increase in the monthly average number of patents asserted per case among cases involving one or more business method patents. The CBM program has decreased the value of business method patents. The board is currently drafting a formal charter that will outline the group’s function, reviewer selection, and membership term. According to board officials, these reviews are meant to help ensure consistency with applicable board rules, other board decisions, and Federal Circuit and Supreme Court case law. In addition, we reviewed publicly available information documenting the steps the board takes to engage with stakeholders, including documentation of webinars, judicial conferences, and roundtable discussions. According to board documents and interviews with officials, the board has also taken steps to help ensure consistency with applicable board rules, other board decisions, and Federal Circuit and Supreme Court case law. In addition, such reviews may result in coaching and training to increase an individual judge’s quality of performance. Regarding completed trials, board officials told us they review any board AIA trial decisions that are appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and that the appeals court reverses or remands. In June 2016, we reported that more than 40 percent of patent examiners can delve much deeper into the invalidity argument on patent clarity grounds at a CBM trials than they can as defendants in district court, mostly because the board judges.

  "We also found, in our analysis of data from tribal justice systems from fiscal years 2015 through 2016, that federal jurisdiction over crimes in Indian country is typically for more serious offenses (specifically under the Major Crimes Act), such as offenses against a person. Comprehensive data from tribal justice systems on the involvement of Native American youth were not available. However, we identified and reviewed a few data sources that provided insights about the arrest, adjudication, and confinement of Native American youth by tribal justice systems. See appendix II for a summary of our analysis of data from these sources. In our September 2018 report, we identified 122 discretionary grants and cooperative agreements (grant programs) offered by DOJ and HHS from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that could help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS made approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards through the 122 programs over the period, of which the agencies awarded about $207.7 million to tribal governments or Native American organizations. A list of the 122 programs, which focus on a range of issues such as violence or trauma, justice system reform, alcohol and substance abuse, and reentry and recidivism, can be found in our September 2018 report. The 122 DOJ and HHS grant programs we identified included 27 programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary and 95 programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as beneficiaries.

The 122 DOJ and HHS grant programs we identified included 27 programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary and 95 programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as beneficiaries. In contrast, there were 246 Native American youth held in federal custody by the U.S. Marshals Service due to arrest by federal LEAs during the same period. We also found a number of similarities between Native American and non-Native American youth in state and local justice systems. For example, the offenses that Native American youth and non-Native American youth were arrested, adjudicated, and confined for were generally similar. For example, the offenses that Native American youth and non-Native American youth were arrested, adjudicated, and confined for were generally similar. In contrast, our analysis also showed a number of differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system. For example, our analysis showed variation in the types of offenses committed by each group. From fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the majority of Native American youth in the federal justice system were arrested, adjudicated, or confined for offenses against a person, with the top two specific offenses being assault and sex offenses. In contrast, the majority of involvement of non-Native American youth in the federal system during the same period was due to public order or drug and alcohol offenses at all three stages, with the top two specific offenses being drug and immigration related. Our September 2018 report contains additional information on the differences between Native American and non-Native American youth involved with the federal justice system.

Chairman Hoeven, Vice Chairman Udall, and Members of the Committee, this completes my prepared statement. Our September 2018 report contains additional information on the differences between Native American and non-Native American youth involved with the federal justice system.

  ", and officials at all six medical centers confirmed that they rely on these inspections to identify needed repairs. For example, officials in one medical center noted that the frequency and thoroughness of these inspections has helped them determine day-to-day wear and tear issues and informed their planning processes. Medical center staff noted that condition deficiencies identified through this process are often minor but are nonetheless important to maintenance of a clean and safe patient environment. For example, a damaged or stained ceiling tile identified during an inspection could be a potential safety hazard to patients or indicate an issue with leaking pipes. The replacement of the tile itself is a minor repair, but that repair could be an indication of an important maintenance issue at the medical center. As table 2 below shows, the deficiencies commonly identified through the inspections process include items that need to be cleaned or dusted or walls that need minor repairs. In 2016, a VHA directive formally established VHA’s Comprehensive Environment of Care Program (Environment of Care Program) and outlined management and oversight responsibilities for the program. In most cases, a deficiency can be addressed with simple repairs such as patching and repainting walls, replacing stained and damaged tiles, or by cleaning.

In most cases, a deficiency can be addressed with simple repairs such as patching and repainting walls, replacing stained and damaged tiles, or by cleaning. On our site visits, we saw examples of the types of issues that medical centers, most conduct environment of care inspections in a different part of their facility every week throughout the year. In 2016, a VHA directive formally established VHA’s Comprehensive Environment of Care Program (Environment of Care Program) and outlined management and oversight responsibilities for the program. Environment of care inspections are a main component of the program. In addition to the environment of care inspections, VHA uses other inspections to help execute and oversee facility operations and maintenance functions. On our site visits, we saw examples of the types of issues that medical center staff address during environment of care inspections. In one case, we were shown a recurring deficiency at the medical center caused by moving hospital beds. Moving beds in and out of rooms was damaging the plaster corners of a wall near the door. We were also shown the solution, which was a metal corner guard the medical center had installed in some rooms, and the center was working to install corner guards in other locations as funds became available. Figure 2 below shows examples of deficiencies we observed during environment of care inspections, while environment of care inspections focus on day-to-day facility conditions, including that of patient-care areas. Other types of condition deficiencies that are not directly in the environment of care, such as a broken boiler, typically The same staff can also be responsible for reconciling the environment of care inspections database with other systems, like the medical center’s work order system and other inspections databases. Medical center staff said that each deficiency can result in as many as four or more separate data entry actions in the Environment of Care inspections database and in a separate system used to track work orders. As an example of the administrative workload related to the inspection process, the Long Beach medical center in California, whose main building was built in 1967, reported the most deficiencies in its VISN. According to VHA data, this medical center reported more than 3,500 environment of care deficiencies related to facility condition in fiscal year 2017, and medical center officials said this resulted in as many as 12,000 or more separate data-entry actions. Additionally, VHA’s aging information technology systems exacerbate the administrative workload. VA medical center officials told us that VHA’s work order system lacks interoperability with the Environment of Care inspections database, resulting in the need to manually record information on deficiencies in both systems. Officials we spoke with at VA medical centers told us that this process can substantially add to post-inspection workload and to the administrative burden associated with tracking and closing out deficiencies.

  "s investments, or releases of larger projects. For example, the Defense investment in our sample was the seventh increment of an ongoing investment; Energy’s system was the first of two phases; the DHS investment was rolled out to two locations prior to deployment to 37 additional locations; and Transportation’s investment had been part of a prototype deployed to four airports. Common factors critical to the success of three or more of the seven investments were: 1. Program officials were actively engaged with stakeholders. 2. Program staff had the necessary knowledge and skills. 3. Senior department and agency executives supported the programs. 4. End users and stakeholders were involved in the development of requirements. 5. End users participated in testing system functionality prior to formal end-user acceptance testing. 6. Government and contractor staff were stable and consistent. 7. Program officials had the necessary knowledge and skills. 8. Programs received sufficient funding. These critical factors help support OMB’s objective of improving the management of large-scale IT investments. As a result, the agency reported that it intends to update its policies and process for CIO certification of adequate incremental development and described planned actions to implement it. As a result, the agency’s policy and process for CIO certification of adequate development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies’ efforts to improve the use of incremental development may not be successful. As a result, the agencies increase the risk that the potential impact of utilizing incremental development to more quickly deliver useful functionality to users and improve the likelihood that these multimillion dollar projects will meet their stated goals, may not be realized. As a result, the officials in the GSA Office of the CIO stated that they are enabling the business customers to serve as better product owners. In May 2014, we reported that, by implementing this change, project staffs have (1) defined and prioritized clearer requirements; (2) selected the proper technical tools to support business needs; and in some cases, the proposed dates for completion have changed several times. In addition, several policies were still being developed. Therefore, we cannot be assured that these documents will fully address the areas we noted in this report. OMB’s fiscal year 2017 CIO certification policies are not consistent with OMB’s CIO certification policies. OMB staff reported that development work was slowed by inefficient governance and oversight processes; 5 agencies reported that development schedules were impeded by procurement delays; 5 agencies identified the lack of funding as their top challenge; 5 agencies identified the lack of stable, prioritized requirements as a challenge. In addition, 3 agencies identified a new challenge which had not been described in our prior work. One approach to reducing software development risks is to divide investments into smaller parts, or increments. While a traditional waterfall software development effort usually is broadly scoped, incremental development is a more complex process. One approach to reducing software development risks is to reduce software development risks. One approach to reducing software development risks is to reduce software development risks. In addition, GSA officials stated that they had experienced delays in meeting their incremental projects’ delivery schedules due to dependencies on multiple complex projects. These officials told us that the agency addressed these delays by improving existing processes and implementing a change control board and an enterprise test development environment. SBA officials reported that delays were introduced when the agency did not have necessary software and hardware available for development activities. Officials noted that these challenges were a result of the agency not maintaining an updated inventory of approved software and developers not having access to laptops needed for development activities. Officials noted that these challenges were a result of the agency not maintaining an updated inventory of approved software and developers not having access to laptops needed for development activities. SBA officials stated that the agency addressed the lack of approved software and equipment needed for incremental development by processing a waiver to use software tools and procuring laptops needed for development activities. Incremental development work was slowed by inefficient governance and oversight processes. Officials from the Office of the CIO at five agencies (Education, HUD, Interior, OPM, and USDA) reported that, while progress has been made in addressing this high-risk area, significant work remains to be completed. For example, as of December 2016, OMB and agencies had implemented 366 (or about 46 percent) of the 803 open recommendations that we had made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015 related to IT acquisitions and operations. As of August 2017, none of the agencies had taken action to address the recommendation; as discussed later in the report. We issued an update to our high-risk report in February 2017 and noted that, while progress has been made in addressing this high-risk area, significant work remains to be completed. For example, as of December 2016",
  " less than needed to perform the work. Further, as of July 2017, IMF projected a shortage of 3 developers (4,042 work hours) needed for the 2018 tax filing season. In an internal document identifying options to address the loss of knowledge caused by the attrition of staff for IMF, IRS reported that it has taken various actions as a result of the ongoing attrition of staff for IMF. Further, IRS provided technical comments, which we incorporated, as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees, the Commissioner of IRS, and other interested parties. This report will also be available at no charge on our website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions on matters discussed in this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9286 or pownerd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. IRS has six strategic goals: (1) drive increased agility, efficiency, effectiveness and security in IRS operations; (2) drive increased agility, efficiency, effectiveness and security in IRS operations. According to IMF risk logs, the investment also reported potential impacts on tax processing as a result of the attrition. These impacts include (1) the agency’s delay in implementing modifications to IMF for the filing season to reflect changes in the tax law, (2) tax processing delays due to the lack of adequate institutional knowledge to resolve complex issues, and (3) reduction in the amount of development work being completed for CADE 2 to address a financial material weakness. According to IMF risk logs, the investment also reported potential impacts on tax processing as a result of the attrition. In February 2015, we reported that the agency had provided summary-level Chief Technology Officer risk assessment ratings for the majority of IT investments in quarterly reporting to Congress. However, as we recently reported, the agency has not provided a target date for decommissioning IMF. The agency reported spending $14.3 million on this investment in fiscal year 2016. Until IRS implements effective key workforce planning practices, it will not be best positioned to address the human capital risks it faces and ensure the timely and effective delivery of its investments. We are making the following 21 recommendations to IRS: The Commissioner of the IRS should ensure the agency had provided summary-level Chief Technology Officer risk assessment ratings for the majority of IT investments in quarterly reporting to Congress. However, the agency did not provide such ratings for selected investments for which Congress required detailed reporting, including CADE 2 and RRP, which are the subject of this review. According to the agency, it spent approximately $2.7 billion on its IT investments during fiscal year 2016. Of the $2.7 billion on its IT investments during fiscal year 2016. Of the $2.7 billion, approximately $1.9 billion (70 percent) was spent for operations and maintenance activities, and approximately $800 million (30 percent) was spent for development, modernization, and enhancement. In response to our recommendation, IRS began providing summary- level risk information for all major investments in its fiscal year 2015 second quarter report to Congress. In its report for the Further, we noted that OMB did not provide a timeline for the implementation of this recommendation. In its March 2017 response to the recommendation, the agency stated that it did not see the benefits of implementing the recommendation for the investment given the minimal development work remaining. IRS has since completed this development work and transitioned ACA to the operations and maintenance phase. We also pointed out that the use of COBOL presents challenges for agencies given that procurement and operating costs associated with this language will steadily rise, and because fewer people with the proper skill sets are available to support the language. In addition, we reported that IRS did not meet the activities for developing alternative courses of action for all critical risks, and establishing threshold values for acceptability of risks, or threshold values for each risk category. For our second objective, we reported that IMF was over 50 years old and, although IRS was working to modernize it, the agency did not have a time frame for completing the modernization or replacement. In addition, we noted that IRS did have not have specific activities or timelines for updating MSSS and EUSS. Thus, we recommended that Treasury direct the CIO to identify and plan to modernize or replace IRS’s legacy systems. The department had no comments on our recommendation. We have also previously reported on agencies’ IT workforce planning efforts. Specifically, in November 2016 we identified eight key IT workforce planning activities based on relevant laws and guidance and noted that the five federal departments in our review, including Treasury, had mixed progress in addressing the risks. In addition, MSSS officials stated that they were not aware of the risk management activities for the three selected investments. In addition, MSSS officials stated that they were not aware of the risk management activities for the three selected investments.

  "ees, including reviewing its monitoring protocols and ensuring all grantees were monitored over a 2- year period. These steps should increase the timeliness, completeness, and consistency of ORR’s monitoring; however, ORR needs to ensure that its updated processes and protocols are fully implemented and in use. In 2016, we reported that ORR relies on grantees to provide care for unaccompanied children, such as housing and educational, medical, and therapeutic services, and to document in children’s case files the services they provide. Grantees are required to provide these services and to document that they did so. However, in our 2016 report, we found that documents—such as legal presentation acknowledgment forms, records of group counseling sessions, or clinical progress notes—were often missing from the 27 randomly selected case files we reviewed. In addition, we identified several cases in which forms that were present in the files were not signed or dated. In addition, we found that although ORR used its web-based data system to track some information about the services children received, and grantees reported on the services they provided in their annual reports, the documents contained in case files were often missing from the 27 randomly selected case files we reviewed. In addition, we identified several cases in which forms that were present in the files were not signed or dated.

In addition, we identified several cases in which forms that were present in the files were not signed or dated. We found that although ORR used its web-based data system to track some information about the services children received, and grantees reported on the services they provided in their annual reports, the documents contained in case files were the primary source of information about the services provided to individual children. We concluded that without including all of the documents in case files, it was difficult for ORR to verify that required services were actually provided in accordance with ORR policy and cooperative agreements. In our 2016 report, these residential care providers, referred to here as grantees, are also responsible for identifying and assessing the suitability of potential sponsors—generally a parent or other relative in the country—who can care for the child after they leave ORR custody. To do this, grantees collect information from potential sponsors and run various background checks. In cases in which there are questions about the ability of the sponsor to meet the child’s needs and provide a safe environment, and for children included in specified categories under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a home study is also conducted. In certain circumstances ORR may also arrange for post- release services for the child. Release to a sponsor or relative is also conducted. In 2015, ORR had instituted a new policy requiring grantee facility staff to place follow-up calls, referred to as Safety and Well Being follow-up calls, to all children and their sponsors 30 days after the children are placed to determine whether they were still living with their sponsors, enrolled in or attending school, and aware of upcoming removal proceedings, and to ensure that they were safe. ORR’s policy required grantees to attempt to contact the sponsor and child at least three times. In August 2017, ORR told us that the agency had created new guidance on case reporting, records management, retention, and information- sharing requirements for post-release service provider, and that it had collected data on Safety and Well Being follow-up calls that had been made to children and their sponsors. For example, ORR told us that during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, its grantees reached 87 percent of unaccompanied children and 90 percent of sponsors by phone within 30 to 37 days after the child’s release from ORR care. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, these figures were 80 percent and 88 percent, respectively. ORR also said that the agency had developed a plan for collecting and analyzing National Call Center data. However, as of April 2018, ORR officials noted that case management functionality had not yet been built into ORR’s web-based portal. Further, ORR’s policy required grantees to attempt to contact the sponsor and child at least three times. In August 2017, ORR told us that the agency had created new guidance on case reporting, records management, retention, and information- sharing requirements for post-release service provider, and that it had collected data on Safety and Well Being follow-up calls that had been made to children and their sponsors by phone within 30 to 37 days after the child’s release from ORR care. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, these figures were 80 percent of children were",

In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets that did not have intermediate targets. In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets that did not have intermediate targets. In these 10 targets, the Study identified how much progress would need to be made each year to achieve each target’s numerical goal by 2035. The TMDL also calls for implementing management actions for nitrogen entering the Sound from other states where feasible. In the TMDL, Connecticut and New York identified the need for an adaptive management approach because it would require nitrogen reduction beyond the limits of technology current at the time. The states also agreed to reassess the nitrogen reduction goals and revise the TMDL. In a letter signed by the Regional Administrators of EPA Region 1 and Region 2, EPA stated that the report is timely because the Study is working to transition from the 1994 plan to evaluating and reporting on the 2015 plan and highlighted steps the agency will take to meet our recommendations. The 2015 plan has four goals, associated with four themes: clean water and healthy watersheds. Clean water and healthy watersheds. The goal associated with four themes are as follows. Clean water and healthy watersheds. In the TMDL, Connecticut and New York identified the need for an adaptive management approach because it would require nitrogen reduction beyond the limits of technology current at the time. The states also agreed to reassess the nitrogen reduction goals and revise the TMDL as necessary. In a letter signed by the Regional Administrators of EPA Region 1 and Region 2, EPA stated that the Study only assigned 75 percent of the 139 implementation actions in the 2015 plan to these four ranges. Instead of a cost range, the Study identified the funding needs for more than This appendix provides information on the scope of work and the methodology used to examine (1) what is known about the progress made toward achieving the 1994 Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (1994 plan); (2) the goals of the 2015 plan; (3) the goals of the 2015 plan; and (4) the goals of the 2015 plan; and (5) the factors that may hinder progress toward the goals of the 2015 plan. In our review of the 2015 plan is the Mussel Watch program, run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science. The Study reported that increasing the number of public access points may be difficult because there are many privately owned properties along the Long Island Sound coast. We did not identify any factors that may hinder progress toward the goals. We did not identify any factors that may hinder progress toward the goals. The 2015 plan defines outcomes as “broad results needed to achieve the goals.” For example, as shown in table 4, an outcome associated with the “clean water and healthy watersheds” theme is “to improve research, monitoring, and modeling for water quality.” Each outcome has multiple associated objectives, which are the accomplishments needed to achieve each outcome, and each objective has multiple strategies. By working with the Study as it finalizes its reporting format to incorporate the leading practices of performance reporting, EPA could help ensure that the Study provides the public and Congress with the information they need to determine whether the Study is making progress toward achieving the long-term targets associated with the goals of the 2015 plan, or whether the Study should take additional action to meet the targets. Study members estimated in the 2015 plan that future restoration activities would cost at least $18.9 billion over 20 years. Nearly all the amount was for activities addressing the goal to achieve clean waters and healthy watersheds."
