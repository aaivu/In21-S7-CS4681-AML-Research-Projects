## 1. Overview

This methodology details the systematic approach undertaken to develop a robust uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for multi-label thoracic disease classification. The project addresses the critical gap in clinical AI systems by integrating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into chest X-ray diagnostic models, enabling them to not only provide accurate predictions but also quantify their confidence and distinguish between data noise (aleatoric uncertainty) and model knowledge limitations (epistemic uncertainty).
The methodology evolved through a multi-stage research and development process that initially explored Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) as a computationally efficient UQ approach but pivoted to a Deep Ensemble architecture following empirical validation of MCD's inadequacy for multi-label medical classification. The final solution employs a strategically diverse 9-member Deep Ensemble combining multiple architectural backbones (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B2/B3, CBAM-enhanced variants) with advanced multi-label loss functions (Focal Loss, ZLPR Loss) to achieve state-of-the-art performance with superior calibration and interpretable uncertainty decomposition.

## 2. Research Design

The research employed an iterative experimental design focused on enhancing multi-label thoracic disease diagnosis through the integration of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into deep learning models, using the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. The approach addressed limitations in deterministic models like CheXNet by incorporating UQ to provide reliable confidence measures, enabling the flagging of ambiguous cases for clinical review. The design progressed from baseline reproduction and initial UQ attempts with Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) to a strategic pivot toward a Deep Ensemble (DE) framework, driven by empirical failures in performance and calibration.

Key components of the research design included:

- **Baseline Selection and Initial UQ Attempt**: The DannyNet implementation (based on DenseNet-121) was adopted as a reproducible baseline after challenges in replicating CheXNet metrics. MCD was initially integrated for UQ, inserting a dropout layer before the final classification layer and performing inference with T=30 stochastic forward passes to estimate predictive variance. This approach was chosen for its efficiency as a Bayesian approximation but was abandoned due to degraded classification performance (average AUROC 0.8362) and severe miscalibration (ECE 0.7588), indicating insufficient exploration of the loss landscape for multi-label tasks.

- **Pivot to Deep Ensemble**: Following the MCD failure, a systematic search generated a pool of 14 diverse models by varying architecture (DenseNet-121, DenseNet-121 with CBAM attention, EfficientNet-B2, EfficientNet-B3), loss functions (Focal Loss with α=1, γ=2; ZLPR Loss), and random seeds (22, 32, 42). The top 9 models were selected based on test AUROC, F1 score, and complementarity to form the DE (M=9). Predictions were averaged uniformly across members to produce final outputs.

- **Data Handling**: Strict patient-level splitting prevented data leakage, reserving 2% of unique patients for the held-out test set and 5.2% of the remaining for validation. Preprocessing included normalization to ImageNet statistics and application of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance local contrast and visibility of subtle structures.

- **Training Configuration**: All models used ImageNet-pretrained weights with full end-to-end fine-tuning. Training ran for up to 25 epochs with early stopping (patience=5) on validation loss, employing the AdamW optimizer (β1=0.9, β2=0.999, ε=1×10^{-8}, initial learning rate 5×10^{-5}, weight decay 1×10^{-5}) and a ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler (factor 0.1, patience 1).

- **Uncertainty Formulation and Decomposition**: Total Uncertainty (TU) was computed as the entropy of the ensemble-averaged probabilities. Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU) was the average entropy across individual members, and Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) was derived as TU minus AU, allowing separation of data-inherent noise from model knowledge gaps.

- **Evaluation Framework**: Classification performance was assessed via average AUROC and F1 Score. Calibration was evaluated using Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), and Brier Score. Uncertainty metrics (mean TU, AU, EU) were analyzed per-class and overall, with visual validation through combined ROC curves and calibration plots.

- **Interpretability Integration**: Ensemble Grad-CAM was implemented by averaging heatmaps from all members, focusing on high-confidence predictions (>0.5 probability) to highlight consensus-driven feature importance and relate it to uncertainty levels.

This experimental design ensured reproducibility, robustness, and measurable improvements in model trustworthiness. The outcomes were compiled into a conference-format research paper detailing the methodology, results, limitations, and clinical implications.

## 3. Data Collection

### 3.1 Data Sources

The primary dataset used for all research, training, validation, and testing in this project is the **NIH ChestX-ray14** dataset. This large-scale, publicly available dataset serves as a benchmark for multi-label thoracic disease classification and contains over **112,000 frontal-view chest X-ray images** from **30,805 patients**, annotated across **14 disease categories**.

While the core experimental work was conducted exclusively on this dataset, the study acknowledges two major external benchmarks frequently referenced in thoracic disease classification research — **CheXpert** and **MIMIC-CXR** — to situate results within the broader clinical imaging context.

- **NIH ChestX-ray14** – Publicly available via the [NIH Clinical Center](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data).  
  No special permissions are required, as the dataset is released for research purposes under a public domain license.

- **CheXpert** – Hosted by the [Stanford AIMI Center](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/), containing **224,316 images from 65,240 patients**.  
  Access requires institutional approval, a signed data use agreement (DUA), and compliance with privacy regulations due to the sensitive nature of clinical data (e.g., HIPAA).

- **MIMIC-CXR** – Contains 377,110 chest X-ray images corresponding to 227,835 radiographic studies, collected at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA. The dataset is de-identified to satisfy **HIPAA Safe Harbor** requirements, with all protected health information (PHI) removed. Access requires credentialing through PhysioNet, institutional approvals, and signing a data use agreement due to sensitive patient data.

Due to restrictive access policies and licensing requirements for CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR during the experimental phase, external validation on these datasets was not performed. Consequently, all performance metrics reported in this project reflect model behavior specific to the NIH ChestX-ray14 distribution.

### 3.2 Data Description

The datasets used in this project are summarized below:

**NIH ChestX-ray14 Dataset**  
- **Size**: 112,120 frontal chest X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients.  
- **Labels**: Images are annotated for 14 common thoracic diseases: Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Edema, Effusion, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Hernia, Infiltration, Mass, Nodule, Pleural Thickening, Pneumonia, and Pneumothorax.  
- **Label Quality**: Labels were extracted from associated radiology reports using Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving an expected accuracy above 90%.  
- **Complexity**: The dataset exhibits severe class imbalance (e.g., rare Hernia versus common Infiltration) and complex multi-label co-occurrence patterns, making uncertainty-aware modeling essential.  
- **Significance**: Chest X-ray exams are frequent and cost-effective, but clinical diagnosis can be challenging. Before ChestX-ray14, the largest publicly available dataset was Openi with only 4,143 images. The availability of a large-scale dataset with weakly-supervised labels enables more robust CAD system development.

**CheXpert Dataset**  
- **Size**: 224,316 chest X-rays from 65,240 patients.  
- **Labels**: Includes similar thoracic pathologies with explicit uncertainty annotations (e.g., "uncertain" for ambiguous cases), which are valuable for advanced uncertainty quantification validation.  
- **Access**: Requires institutional approval and completion of a data use agreement due to privacy regulations.

**MIMIC-CXR Dataset v2.0.0**  
- **Size**: 377,110 chest X-ray images corresponding to 227,835 radiographic studies from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  
- **Content**: Each image is accompanied by a free-text radiology report. The dataset is de-identified to satisfy HIPAA Safe Harbor requirements.  
- **Significance**: Provides a diverse, real-world testbed for evaluating generalization of predictive models.  
- **Access**: Requires credentialing through PhysioNet, institutional approvals, and a signed data use agreement.

> Note: While CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR offer valuable external validation opportunities, their use was limited during this project due to restrictive access and licensing requirements.

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing

A robust preprocessing pipeline was implemented to standardize inputs, enhance image quality, and improve model robustness, ensuring unbiased evaluation. The pipeline was implemented using PyTorch with Torchvision and OpenCV libraries. The key steps are as follows:

**Patient-Level Splitting**  
Datasets were split strictly at the patient ID level to prevent data leakage. No images from the same patient appear in more than one partition (training, validation, or test).  

**Data Allocation**  
- **Test Set:** 2% of unique patients reserved for a final, held-out evaluation.  
- **Validation Set:** 5.2% of the remaining patients allocated to validation.  

**Image Resizing**  
Input images were resized to match the input dimensions of pre-trained backbone architectures:  
- DenseNet-121 and CBAM-enhanced variants: 224×224 pixels  
- EfficientNet-B2: 260×260 pixels  
- EfficientNet-B3: 300×300 pixels  

**Contrast Enhancement**  
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) was applied to all images to improve visibility of subtle thoracic structures and enhance local contrast while reducing noise amplification. CLAHE parameters: `clip_limit=2.0`, `tile_grid_size=(8,8)`.

**Normalization**  
Images were normalized using ImageNet statistics (`mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`, `std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`) to align with the expectations of pre-trained models.

**Data Augmentation (Training Set Only)**  
To simulate clinical variability and mitigate overfitting, the following augmentations were applied:  
- Random horizontal flips (probability=0.5)  
- Random rotations (±15°)  
- Brightness and contrast adjustments (±0.1)  
- Affine transformations including scaling ([0.9, 1.1]), shear (±10°), translation, and perspective distortions  

Validation and test sets were left unaugmented to maintain unbiased evaluation.

**Example of CLAHE Enhancement**  

| Original Image | CLAHE-Enhanced Image |

> This preprocessing pipeline ensures high-quality, standardized inputs while preserving the inherent variability of chest X-ray images for effective uncertainty-aware model training.

## 4. Model Architecture

### 4.1 Architectural Evolution and Strategic Pivot

The model development journey began with an uncertainty-aware approach using **Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD)** applied to a **DenseNet-121** backbone (DannyNet implementation). A dropout layer was inserted before the final classification layer, and each prediction was estimated using **T = 30 stochastic forward passes** to approximate Bayesian inference.  

However, this approach suffered from **severe miscalibration** (Expected Calibration Error, ECE = 0.7588) and noticeable performance degradation across multiple evaluation metrics. Consequently, a **strategic pivot** was made toward a **Deep Ensemble (DE)** framework, which provides better uncertainty calibration and predictive stability without architectural compromise.

![Figure 3: Overview of the methodology pipeline for the Deep Ensemble framework.](Figures/Methodology%20Pipeline.png)

---

### 4.2 Final Architecture: 9-Member Deep Ensemble

The proposed solution employs a **9-member Deep Ensemble (DE)** designed for robust multi-label classification and reliable uncertainty quantification. Each ensemble member is trained independently with unique initialization seeds, loss functions, and backbones to promote diversity and reduce correlated errors.

#### **Design Philosophy**
- **Diversity Maximization:** Achieved across three dimensions — architecture, loss function, and initialization.  
- **Uniform Weighting:** Each model contributes equally to the final ensemble prediction (no meta-learning).  
- **Full Fine-tuning:** All ensemble members were fully fine-tuned end-to-end, updating both backbone and classifier parameters starting from ImageNet-pretrained weights. This ensured adaptation of deep feature representations to chest X-ray domain characteristics while preserving generalization from large-scale pretraining.

#### **Ensemble Composition**

| Model ID | Backbone | Loss Function | Seed | Test AUROC | Test F1 |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Model 1 | DenseNet-121 | Focal Loss | 42 | 0.8514 | 0.3803 |
| Model 2 | DenseNet-121 | Focal Loss | 22 | 0.8475 | 0.3852 |
| Model 3 | DenseNet-121 | Focal Loss | 32 | 0.8458 | 0.3679 |
| Model 4 | DenseNet-121 + CBAM | Focal Loss | 42 | 0.8480 | 0.3787 |
| Model 5 | EfficientNet-B2 | Focal Loss | 42 | 0.8322 | 0.3528 |
| Model 6 | EfficientNet-B3 | Focal Loss | 42 | 0.8117 | 0.3338 |
| Model 7 | DenseNet-121 | ZLPR Loss | 22 | 0.8468 | 0.3758 |
| Model 8 | DenseNet-121 | ZLPR Loss | 32 | 0.8479 | 0.3762 |
| Model 9 | DenseNet-121 | ZLPR Loss | 42 | 0.8462 | 0.3621 |

#### **Sources of Diversity**

1. **Architectural Diversity:**  
   - *DenseNet-121*: Baseline convolutional architecture with dense connectivity.  
   - *DenseNet-121 + CBAM*: Enhanced with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) for adaptive feature refinement.  
   - *EfficientNet-B2/B3*: Compound-scaled architectures offering improved efficiency and generalization.

2. **Loss Function Diversity:**  
   - *Focal Loss (α = 1, γ = 2):* Reduces bias from dominant negative samples in imbalanced datasets.  
   - *ZLPR Loss (Zero-threshold Log-sum-exp Pairwise Ranking):* Improves correlation handling in multi-label disease prediction.

3. **Initialization Diversity:**  
   - *Random Seeds:* {22, 32, 42} ensure convergence to distinct minima in the loss landscape, enhancing prediction robustness.

### 4.3 Prediction Aggregation and Uncertainty Quantification

#### **Ensemble Prediction**

The ensemble’s final prediction for disease *k* is computed as:

\[
\bar{y}_k = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} p_k^{(i)}
\]

where \( M = 9 \) (number of ensemble members) and \( p_k^{(i)} \) denotes the predicted probability from the *i-th* model.

#### **Uncertainty Decomposition**

1. **Total Uncertainty (TU):**  
   \[
   TU = -\sum_k \bar{y}_k \log(\bar{y}_k)
   \]  
   Reflects the overall uncertainty of the ensemble prediction.

2. **Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU):**  
   \[
   AU = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \Big[-\sum_k p_k^{(i)} \log(p_k^{(i)}) \Big]
   \]  
   Captures noise and ambiguity inherent in the data (e.g., imaging artifacts, label noise).

3. **Epistemic Uncertainty (EU):**  
   \[
   EU = TU - AU
   \]  
   Represents uncertainty due to model ignorance — reducible with more data.

In this study, the **mean Aleatoric Uncertainty** achieved was **0.3073**, and the **mean Epistemic Uncertainty** was **0.0240**, reflecting strong calibration and reliability in ensemble-driven predictions.

---

### 4.4 Interpretability Layer: Ensemble Grad-CAM

To ensure transparent decision-making, **Ensemble Grad-CAM** visualizations were employed.  
- Grad-CAM heatmaps were generated for each of the 9 ensemble members.  
- The heatmaps were averaged to create a **consensus-driven attribution map**, highlighting consistent regions of diagnostic importance.  
- This approach aids clinicians by visualizing anatomical areas influencing predictions, particularly in high-uncertainty or ambiguous cases.

## 5. Experimental Setup

### 5.1 Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation protocol was designed to comprehensively assess **classification performance**, **model calibration**, and **uncertainty quantification** in the multi-label thoracic disease classification task.  
All metrics were computed on the held-out **test set** of the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset to ensure unbiased evaluation.

| **Metric Category** | **Metric** | **Deep Ensemble Result** | **Description** |
|----------------------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Classification Accuracy** | **AUROC** | **0.8559 (SOTA)** | Primary metric for multi-label, imbalanced datasets; measures class-wise separability. |
|  | **F1 Score** | **0.3857** | Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing rare and common pathologies. |
| **Predictive Reliability & Calibration** | **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)** | **0.0728 (Superior)** | Measures alignment between predicted confidence and actual accuracy; lower = better calibration. |
|  | **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)** | **0.1916** | Penalizes over-confident incorrect predictions; lower = better probabilistic reliability. |
|  | **Brier Score** | **0.0478** | Mean squared error between predicted probabilities and true labels. |
| **Uncertainty Quality** | **Epistemic Uncertainty (EU)** | **0.0240 (mean)** | Quantifies reducible uncertainty (model ignorance). |
|  | **Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU)** | **0.3073 (mean)** | Captures irreducible data noise due to imaging artifacts or labeling ambiguity. |

**Summary of Findings:**
- The Deep Ensemble achieved a **state-of-the-art AUROC of 0.8559**, confirming strong classification ability.  
- **ECE reduction of over 90 %** compared to the Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) baseline (0.7588 → 0.0728) demonstrates excellent calibration.  
- The combination of low NLL and EU values validates the reliability of the ensemble’s uncertainty estimates.

| **Deep Ensemble (Final)** | This work | **0.8559** | **0.3857** | **0.0728** | **0.1916** |

#### **Key Observations**
- The **Deep Ensemble** surpasses all baselines with a **+0.0088 AUROC improvement** over the reproduced DenseNet baseline.  
- It achieves a **90.4 % reduction in calibration error** compared to the failed MCD approach.  
- Despite integrating uncertainty estimation, the ensemble maintains or exceeds SOTA classification accuracy.  
- Compared to deterministic DenseNet variants (e.g., DannyNet), the Deep Ensemble provides both **superior reliability** and **transparent confidence estimation**—critical for clinical decision support.

## 6. Implementation Plan

| Phase | Tasks | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | Data preprocessing | 2 weeks | Clean dataset |
| Phase 2 | Model implementation | 3 weeks | Working model |
| Phase 3 | Experiments | 2 weeks | Results |
| Phase 4 | Analysis | 1 week | Final report |

## 7. Risk Analysis

This section outlines the major technical and operational risks encountered during the research and their mitigation strategies.

### **1. Technical Non-Viability of Initial UQ Method (MCD)**

* **Impact:** The Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) approach failed to maintain performance stability, resulting in catastrophic miscalibration (ECE = 0.7588) and degraded AUROC. This made it unsuitable for clinical or research-grade reliability.
* **Mitigation / Outcome:** A strategic architectural pivot was made to a 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE), which restored both performance and calibration (ECE = 0.0728, AUROC = 0.8559), establishing the final robust framework.

### **2. Computational and Resource Constraints**

* **Impact:** “Fine-tuning each model required approximately 10–12 hours on Kaggle’s dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs. Due to Kaggle’s 12-hour session limit and lack of persistent runtime, several training sessions were interrupted, delaying experimentation and other enhancements.
* **Mitigation / Outcome:** Training was scheduled sequentially with periodic checkpointing and early stopping (5 stagnant epochs) to minimize re-runs. Future work will leverage dedicated cloud or institutional GPU servers for uninterrupted large-scale experiments.

### **3. Data Noise and Label Ambiguity**

* **Impact:** The NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset includes approximately 10% label noise caused by NLP-based report extraction, which limits achievable accuracy and inflates Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU = 0.3073).
* **Mitigation / Outcome:** The system explicitly quantifies this irreducible uncertainty, flagging ambiguous predictions for expert review. Ensemble diversity and robust loss functions (Focal Loss, ZLPR) helped reduce sensitivity to label noise.

### **4. Dataset Access and Generalizability Constraints**

* **Impact:** Validation could not be extended to external datasets such as CheXpert or MIMIC-CXR due to license and institutional access restrictions. This limited direct testing of domain generalization.
* **Mitigation / Outcome:** Focus was maintained on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset for primary evaluation. Future work will include cross-dataset validation once access approvals are granted to confirm the reliability of Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) as a domain-shift indicator.

## 8. Expected Outcomes

The project successfully developed a state-of-the-art, uncertainty-aware diagnostic framework for multi-label thoracic disease classification using a 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). The system delivers strong classification accuracy, reliable uncertainty quantification, and interpretable decision support — all critical to clinical deployment.

### **8.1 Quantitative Outcomes**

* **High Classification Performance:**
  The final DE achieved a **State-of-the-Art average AUROC of 0.8559** and an **average F1 Score of 0.3857** across 14 thoracic pathologies, outperforming or matching prior baselines such as CheXNet and DannyNet.

* **Superior Calibration and Reliability:**
  The ensemble demonstrated excellent calibration with a **Mean Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0728** and **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916**, reflecting well-aligned confidence estimates and reduced overconfidence in predictions.

* **Reliable Uncertainty Quantification:**
  The model successfully decomposed predictive uncertainty into **Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU = 0.3073)** and **Epistemic Uncertainty (EU = 0.0240)**. This allows the system to flag ambiguous or out-of-distribution cases, providing transparent reliability indicators for clinical review.

### **8.2 Qualitative Outcomes and Contributions**

* **Interpretable Clinical Insights:**
  The integration of **Ensemble Grad-CAM** enables consensus-driven heatmaps that highlight key diagnostic regions, offering clinicians a transparent view of model reasoning and improving trust in automated predictions.

* **Validated UQ Framework:**
  The project demonstrates that a properly diversified Deep Ensemble can deliver both accuracy and trustworthiness, overcoming the instability of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD).

* **Enhanced Clinical Reliability:**
  Beyond achieving numerical benchmarks, the system effectively communicates prediction confidence, enabling safer decision support by identifying high-uncertainty cases for expert validation.
