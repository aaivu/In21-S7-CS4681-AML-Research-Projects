# 9. Uncertainty Quantification with Monte Carlo Dropout (DenseNet-121)

## Implementation Summary

This experiment integrates uncertainty quantification into the DenseNet-121 model using Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout). The same random seed (42), Focal Loss, and other training settings were used as in the baseline experiment to ensure a fair comparison:

- **Model:** DenseNet-121 (without CLAHE enhancement)(Model that was used under experiment 3).
- **MC Dropout Integration:**  
	- A Dropout layer is inserted before the final classifier.
	- At inference, dropout is kept active and the model performs T = 30 stochastic forward passes (`mc_forward_passes`).
	- For each input, the mean predicted probability across passes is used as the final prediction.
	- The variance (or standard deviation) across passes is used as an uncertainty score (epistemic uncertainty).
- **What this achieves:**  
	- MC Dropout approximates sampling from the posterior over model weights, providing a predictive distribution.
	- The mean prediction is the marginalised predictive probability.
	- The variance across runs reflects model (epistemic) uncertainty.
	- Note: This does not capture aleatoric (data) uncertainty.

> **Observation:**  
> After integrating MC Dropout, the modelâ€™s overall AUROC dropped slightly, and most per-class AUROC scores are marginally lower. This is expected, as MC Dropout introduces stochasticity and regularization, but provides valuable uncertainty estimates for each prediction.


## Next Steps

As a next step, I plan to explore ensemble methods for uncertainty quantification. Combining predictions and uncertainties from multiple diverse models is expected to further improve both predictive performance and the reliability of uncertainty estimates.
