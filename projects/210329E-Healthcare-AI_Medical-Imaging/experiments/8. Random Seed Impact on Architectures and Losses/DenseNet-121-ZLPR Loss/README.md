**Summary:**
Seed 12 achieves the highest AUROC for Fibrosis, Hernia, Nodule, and Pneumonia. Seed 22 performs best for Cardiomegaly, Emphysema, Pleural Thickening, and Pneumothorax. Seed 32 yields the top AUROC for Atelectasis, Consolidation, Effusion, and Infiltration. Seed 42 is best for Edema and Mass. This highlights that while all seeds perform robustly, certain seeds may offer advantages for specific disease classes.
