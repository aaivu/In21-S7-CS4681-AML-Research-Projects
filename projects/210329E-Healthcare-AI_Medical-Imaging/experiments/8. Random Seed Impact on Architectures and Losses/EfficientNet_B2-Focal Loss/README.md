## Summary
- The CLAHE-enhanced EfficientNet-B2 with Focal Loss achieves high and stable AUROC across all random seeds, with only minor variation in per-class and overall metrics.
- Seed 42 achieves the highest overall AUROC, but all seeds perform strongly, demonstrating the robustness of this configuration.
- This model serves as a strong baseline for further experiments and comparisons with other loss functions or architectures.

**Summary:**
Seed 22 achieves the highest AUROC for Cardiomegaly, Infiltration, Pleural Thickening, and Pneumothorax. Seed 32 is best for Hernia and (tied with 42) for Emphysema. Seed 42 yields the top AUROC for Atelectasis, Consolidation, Edema, Effusion, Fibrosis, Mass, Nodule, and Pneumonia, and is tied for Emphysema. This highlights that while all seeds perform robustly, certain seeds may offer advantages for specific disease classes.
