## Abstract

This research proposal outlines an investigation into enhancing Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) models for recommendation systems through the integration of a self-supervised contrastive learning task, termed NCF-SSL. While NCF effectively captures non-linear user-item interactions, its performance is often limited by the inherent sparsity of interaction data. The proposed NCF-SSL introduces an auxiliary contrastive loss that regularizes user and item embeddings by enforcing consistency across augmented views of the same entity. This aims to learn more robust and discriminative representations, even with sparse supervision. The proposal details the methodology, experimental setup, and anticipated analysis, including a comparison against the NCF baseline on benchmark datasets and an examination of embedding space characteristics. Expected outcomes include a demonstrated improvement in recommendation accuracy and a deeper understanding of self-supervised learning's regularization effects on foundational CF models.

## 1. Introduction

Recommendation systems are indispensable tools in today's digital landscape, vital for personalizing user experiences across diverse platforms from e-commerce to content streaming. These systems effectively combat information overload by proactively suggesting items tailored to individual preferences. Among the various paradigms, Collaborative Filtering (CF) has remained a cornerstone, leveraging collective user behavior to infer individual tastes. The advent of deep learning revolutionized CF with models like Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) [1], which employs neural networks to model intricate, non-linear user-item interactions, surpassing the limitations of traditional linear Matrix Factorization. This research aims to further advance deep learning-based recommendation by addressing a fundamental challenge: data sparsity.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite its expressive power, the standard NCF model's performance is significantly constrained by the extreme sparsity of user-item interaction data. The supervision signal derived from sparse observed interactions is often insufficient for learning high-quality, robust latent representations for users and items that generalize well to unseen data. This limitation can lead to brittle embeddings, hinder the recommendation of long-tail items, and ultimately reduce the overall accuracy and personalization effectiveness of the recommender system. There is a need for methods that can enrich the learning process and regularize the embedding space without relying on additional explicit feedback or complex architectural overhauls.

## 3. Literature Review Summary

Our comprehensive literature review surveyed advancements in deep learning-based collaborative filtering, categorized into architectural innovations and training strategy improvements. Key architectural developments include Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) like NGCF [2] and LightGCN [3], which explicitly model user-item graphs, and the integration of attention mechanisms [4]. In training strategies, a shift from pointwise to learning-to-rank objectives like BPR [5] has been observed. Most notably, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), particularly contrastive learning, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation learning in sparse domains, with examples like SGL [6] applying it to GNNs.

**Identified Research Gap:** While SSL has proven highly effective, its direct application to foundational, non-graph-based NCF architectures remains underexplored. Most SSL work in recommendation builds on more complex models. This presents an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of SSL as a resource-efficient enhancement for established deep CF baselines like NCF.

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To design, implement, and empirically evaluate NCF-SSL, a novel framework that integrates a self-supervised contrastive learning task into the Neural Collaborative Filtering model to enhance the quality of user and item embeddings and improve recommendation accuracy.

### Secondary Objectives
- To demonstrate that NCF-SSL outperforms the standard NCF baseline on widely accepted top-K ranking metrics on benchmark datasets.
- To conduct an in-depth analysis of the embedding space characteristics (e.g., embedding norm distribution, clustering behavior) to understand how the self-supervised task regularizes learned representations.
- To investigate the robustness of NCF-SSL's embeddings, particularly for users and items with sparse interaction histories, thereby mitigating the impact of data sparsity.
- To provide a clear methodology for integrating self-supervised learning into foundational deep CF models, offering a resource-efficient path to improved performance.

## 5. Methodology

The research will employ an empirical comparative methodology. We will adapt the NCF (NeuMF variant) architecture by introducing a multi-task learning objective.
* **Data Augmentation:** Embedding dropout will be applied to user and item embeddings to create two distinct augmented "views" for each entity within a batch.
* **Dual NCF Paths:** These two augmented views will be fed into two parallel, identical NCF model structures (GMF + MLP), each producing a predicted interaction score.
* **Multi-Task Loss:** The total loss will be a weighted sum ($\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{NCF} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{SSL}$) of:
    * **Recommendation Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{NCF}$):** Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss on the predicted scores, averaged across the two augmented views.
    * **Self-Supervised Contrastive Loss ($\mathcal{L}_{SSL}$):** InfoNCE loss applied to the augmented user and item embeddings. This loss encourages consistency between the two views of the same entity while pushing them away from other entities in the batch.
* **Dataset:** Experiments will be conducted on the MovieLens 1M dataset, converted to implicit feedback with a 1:49 positive-to-negative sampling ratio and a leave-one-out evaluation strategy.
* **Evaluation:** Performance will be measured using HR@10 and NDCG@10.
* **Analysis:** We will analyze embedding norm distributions, visualize embeddings using t-SNE, and examine representation quality for sparse-interaction entities.

## 6. Expected Outcomes

We expect to achieve the following outcomes:
* A robust and thoroughly tested implementation of NCF-SSL that demonstrates superior performance over the NCF baseline on benchmark datasets.
* Empirical evidence showing NCF-SSL's ability to learn more discriminative and robust user and item representations, as supported by embedding analysis.
* A deeper understanding of how self-supervised contrastive learning, applied directly to NCF, mitigates the challenges posed by data sparsity.
* A research paper detailing the proposed methodology, experimental results, and insights, suitable for publication in academic venues.
* A foundation for future work, exploring more advanced augmentation strategies and the application of SSL to other foundational and state-of-the-art recommendation architectures.
