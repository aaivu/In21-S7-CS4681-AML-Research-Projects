## Abstract

Transformer-based models have demonstrated exceptional promise in long-term time series forecasting. The state-of-the-art PatchTST architecture introduced patching and channel-independence, improving performance by capturing local semantic information efficiently. However, its reliance on a single patch size restricts its ability to model the multi-scale nature of real-world time series.

This study introduces Selective Multi-Scale PatchTST (MS-PatchTST), a novel architecture that processes input sequences across parallel patch granularities (small, medium, large) and fuses their outputs through a learned fusion layer. This approach enables simultaneous modeling of fine-grained and long-term dependencies. Experiments show up to 5–15% improvement in MSE over the baseline PatchTST on standard benchmarks, with robust generalization across multiple datasets.


## 1. Introduction

Long-term forecasting is vital for domains such as energy, finance, and traffic management. While the Transformer architecture revolutionized sequence modeling, its quadratic attention cost (O(L²)) and single-scale input tokenization limit its adaptability to time series tasks.

PatchTST overcame several of these constraints by segmenting inputs into subseries-level patches and using independent channel processing. However, it still views data through a single temporal resolution, missing fine- and coarse-grained temporal dynamics.

This research addresses that gap by proposing MS-PatchTST, a multi-scale extension of PatchTST that captures temporal features across multiple resolutions and combines them via a learnable fusion mechanism.


## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Transformer-Based Forecasting

Early models such as Informer and Autoformer adapted Transformer attention for time series by reducing complexity or integrating decomposition mechanisms. FEDformer and Pyraformer advanced this further through frequency-domain and pyramidal attention approaches. Yet these models often rely on single-point tokenization, limiting their ability to capture local semantics.

### 2.2 Patching and Tokenization

Inspired by Vision Transformers (ViT), patching treats local subseries as tokens, allowing models like PatchTST to reduce complexity while maintaining interpretability. Patching improves context modeling but remains limited to a single patch scale, leading to underrepresentation of multi-frequency behaviors.

### 2.3 Multi-Scale Analysis

Prior works such as LogTrans, Autoformer, and Triformer incorporated multi-scale concepts indirectly. However, none allowed explicit, learnable multi-resolution feature extraction. MS-PatchTST formally introduces a parallel, learnable multi-scale processing framework.


## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Revisiting PatchTST

PatchTST models each univariate channel independently, applying instance normalization followed by segmentation into patches of length P and stride S.

This reduces sequence length from L to approximately L/S, lowering attention complexity from O(L²) to O((L/S)²).

A vanilla Transformer encoder processes these patches, and the flattened latent representation is mapped to a forecast horizon T.

### 3.2 Multi-Scale PatchTST (MS-PatchTST)

MS-PatchTST extends the baseline model by introducing:

1. **Parallel Multi-Scale Backbones**  
   Multiple PatchTST backbones, each with different patch lengths (e.g., 8, 16, 32), process the same input independently to capture fine, medium, and coarse patterns.

2. **Learned Fusion Layer**  
   Outputs from all scales are concatenated and passed through a trainable fusion network that learns optimal weighting for each temporal scale during end-to-end training.

**Equation:**

$$\hat{x}^{(i)} = f_{\text{fusion}}([\hat{x}_1^{(i)}; \hat{x}_2^{(i)}; \ldots; \hat{x}_k^{(i)}])$$

This allows the model to dynamically determine which scale contributes most to the prediction.

## 6. Discussion

The results confirm that multi-scale learning enhances the model's ability to capture complex temporal dependencies.

While performance improved on cyclic datasets, tasks dominated by a single temporal frequency (like ILI) benefited less.

This underscores the importance of MS-PatchTST's selective configurability, allowing users to choose scale combinations that balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

Future work includes developing an adaptive scale selection mechanism that automatically learns optimal scale combinations during training.


## 7. Conclusion

This work introduced MS-PatchTST, a multi-scale Transformer architecture for long-term time series forecasting.

By processing inputs across parallel patch scales and integrating them via a learned fusion layer, the model effectively captures both short-term and long-term dependencies.

Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrated consistent accuracy gains and improved robustness over the baseline PatchTST.

The selective, configurable nature of MS-PatchTST establishes a strong foundation for future research in adaptive, scalable time-series forecasting architectures.
