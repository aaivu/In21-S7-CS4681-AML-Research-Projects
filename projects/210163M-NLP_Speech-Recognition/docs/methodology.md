## 1. Overview

The primary goal of this research is to **outperform the baseline WeNet end-to-end ASR system using WavLM as a standalone self-supervised speech model**. The study evaluates WavLM’s ability to achieve lower WER, improved noise robustness, and efficient inference compared to WeNet, without modifying or integrating into WeNet’s architecture.

## 2. Research Design

The research follows a **comparative experimental design**:

1. Establish baseline ASR performance using WeNet on standard benchmarks.  
2. Fine-tune and evaluate WavLM on the same datasets.  
3. Apply enhancement strategies directly to WavLM, such as selective layer fine-tuning, data augmentation, and knowledge distillation.  
4. Perform systematic evaluation and ablation studies.  
5. Optimize WavLM hyperparameters and compression techniques for real-time deployment.  

This design emphasizes **direct comparison** between WavLM and WeNet to quantify performance improvements.

## 3. Data Collection

### 3.1 Data Sources
- **LibriSpeech**: English read speech benchmark. 
- **Optional**: VoxPopuli, GigaSpeech for domain diversity.

### 3.2 Data Description
- **LibriSpeech**: ~1,000 hours, split into train/dev/test sets.

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing
- Audio normalization and resampling to 16 kHz.  
- Feature extraction: WavLM handles raw waveform input, but optional preprocessing includes trimming and augmentation.  
- Data augmentation: noise addition, speed perturbation, and SpecAugment.

## 4. Model Architecture

- **Baseline Model**: Standard WeNet U2++ architecture with log-Mel filterbanks.  
- **Proposed Model**: WavLM pre-trained self-supervised model, optionally fine-tuned on task-specific datasets:  
  - Selective layer fine-tuning for efficiency.  
  - Knowledge distillation to smaller models for faster inference.  
  - Optional adaptation for noisy or multi-speaker conditions.

## 5. Experimental Setup

### 5.1 Evaluation Metrics
- **Word Error Rate (WER)** – primary ASR accuracy metric.  
- **Character Error Rate (CER)** – primary ASR accuracy metric.  
- **Memory Usage** – GPU/CPU peak usage.  
- **Latency** – inference time for real-time evaluation.

### 5.2 Baseline Models
- **WeNet Baseline** – original U2++ ASR system.  
- **WavLM Standalone** – self-supervised model with fine-tuning applied.

### 5.3 Hardware/Software Requirements
- GPU: NVIDIA A100 / V100.  
- Frameworks: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers or WavLM repository.  
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, torchaudio.  
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or equivalent Linux.
