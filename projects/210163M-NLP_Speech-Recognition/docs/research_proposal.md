## Abstract

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has evolved significantly with the introduction of transformer-based architectures such as Wav2Vec2 and WavLM. Despite remarkable accuracy, many open-source ASR systems like WeNet still struggle to generalize across varying acoustic environments and speaker variations. This research aims to fine-tune and optimize the WavLM-Large model for end-to-end speech recognition to outperform WeNet on benchmark datasets such as LibriSpeech. The study will explore training strategies, model regularization, and the integration of external language models such as KenLM to enhance decoding accuracy. The ultimate goal is to reduce the Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) beyond state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. This research contributes to developing more robust, noise-tolerant ASR systems applicable to real-world speech interfaces.

## 1. Introduction

Speech recognition plays a vital role in modern human-computer interaction systems such as virtual assistants, transcription tools, and voice-controlled devices. The field has transitioned from Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to deep neural network (DNN)-based architectures, with transformer-based self-supervised learning (SSL) models now dominating ASR benchmarks. Among these, WavLM [2] has demonstrated superior representation learning over prior models like Wav2Vec2 [1].  
WeNet [8], a popular end-to-end ASR toolkit, achieves competitive low single-digit WERs on LibriSpeech test-clean. However, performance can still be improved by leveraging advanced self-supervised representations and optimized decoding mechanisms. This research seeks to enhance ASR performance by systematically fine-tuning the WavLM-Large model and incorporating optimized decoding using KenLM [5].

## 2. Problem Statement

Although transformer-based ASR models like WeNet achieve strong results, they often exhibit limitations in generalization, robustness, and decoding accuracy under low-resource fine-tuning conditions. Current open-source ASR toolkits do not fully exploit WavLM’s rich speech representation capabilities. Therefore, the problem addressed in this research is:

> How can fine-tuning and optimizing WavLM-Large with advanced decoding strategies outperform the state-of-the-art WeNet system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) on standard benchmarks?

## 3. Literature Review Summary

Recent advances in speech recognition have been driven by self-supervised learning methods, such as Wav2Vec2 [1], HuBERT [3], and WavLM [2], which pretrain large transformer models on unlabeled audio data. WavLM introduced denoising and speaker-aware pretraining, enabling superior contextual modeling.  
Research by [6] and [4] on Conformer and convolutional-transformer architectures demonstrates that contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms improve ASR performance significantly. Additionally, external language models such as KenLM [5] and Cold Fusion show strong decoding improvements by integrating syntactic and lexical context.  
However, prior works often focus on large-scale pretraining or single-pass fine-tuning, lacking a deep evaluation of fine-tuning strategies for models like WavLM. This research addresses that gap by systematically fine-tuning WavLM and integrating optimized LM decoding to minimize WER and CER beyond WeNet’s performance.

## 5. Methodology

1. **Dataset Selection and Preprocessing:**  
   The LibriSpeech dataset (clean-100 and clean-460 subsets) will be used. Audio will be resampled to 16 kHz and normalized. Transcripts will be aligned and cleaned.  

2. **Model Fine-Tuning:**  
   Fine-tune the pretrained `microsoft/wavlm-large` model using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. Two main configurations will be explored:  
   - **Experiment 1–2:** Custom CTC head fine-tuning on subsets (100h and 460h).  
   - **Experiment 3–4:** Incorporation of KenLM decoding and hyperparameter tuning (alpha, beta).  

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   Models will be evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) on both validation and test splits of LibriSpeech.  

4. **Optimization:**  
   Perform hyperparameter tuning for learning rate, dropout, and batch size. Experiment with cosine learning rate schedulers and gradient accumulation. Integrate KenLM with alpha–beta grid search to optimize decoding.  

5. **Comparison:**  
   Compare fine-tuned WavLM performance with WeNet’s reported results and other open-source ASR baselines [7].
