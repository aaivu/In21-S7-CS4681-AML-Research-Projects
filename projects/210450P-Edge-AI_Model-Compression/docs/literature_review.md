## Abstract

This literature review explores the domain of **Edge AI and model compression**, focusing on **quantization techniques** as an enabler for deploying deep neural networks on **resource-constrained devices**. The review covers efficient architectures such as **EfficientNetV2**, various **quantization methodologies** including Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), and complementary compression methods like pruning and knowledge distillation. The key findings indicate that quantization, especially when coupled with QAT, achieves significant reductions in model size and latency while maintaining near-baseline accuracy, making it a practical choice for **on-device inference** in embedded and mobile systems.

## 1. Introduction

Edge AI focuses on executing machine learning models directly on **local devices** such as smartphones, IoT sensors, and embedded platforms, avoiding reliance on cloud servers. However, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are computationally intensive, requiring large memory and energy resources.
**Model compression** addresses these challenges by reducing computational and memory footprints without significantly sacrificing accuracy. **Quantization**, a core compression technique, reduces the numerical precision of weights and activations (e.g., from 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers).
This review surveys recent work on efficient neural architectures, quantization techniques, and deployment strategies aimed at **improving inference efficiency and energy consumption for edge devices**.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

### Gap 1: Lack of real-device quantization benchmarking

**Why it matters:** Most quantization studies evaluate performance in simulation environments rather than physical devices, limiting practical insights.
**How your project addresses it:** By deploying quantized EfficientNetV2 models on real hardware (e.g., ARM CPUs, Jetson, Edge TPU), your project will validate real-world latency, energy use, and accuracy.

### Gap 2: Limited exploration of extreme quantization (int8 and below)

**Why it matters:** Extreme quantization remains underexplored for complex models like EfficientNetV2 due to representational challenges.
**How your project addresses it:** Your research systematically studies PTQ and QAT under aggressive integer quantization to balance compression, accuracy, and latency.

---

## 5. Theoretical Framework

This research builds upon the **theory of numerical representation reduction** in neural networks, leveraging **quantization mathematics** where weights and activations are discretized within finite bit-widths. The approach is grounded in the trade-off between **information fidelity and computational efficiency**, supported by deep learning optimization theory and **hardware-aware inference models**.

---

## 6. Methodology Insights

Common methodologies in this domain include:

* **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** using representative datasets for calibration.
* **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** to simulate quantization during backpropagation.
* **Benchmarking pipelines** using frameworks like TensorFlow Lite for accuracy, model size, and latency comparison.

Your project adopts a **TensorFlow-based reproducible pipeline**, utilizing **EfficientNetV2B0** as a testbed and **ImageNet-Mini** as a dataset for prototyping edge AI quantization workflows.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The literature establishes quantization as a key enabler for **efficient Edge AI deployment**. While PTQ provides simplicity and speed, QAT delivers superior accuracy under extreme precision constraints. Hybrid compression approaches (quantization + pruning/distillation) hold potential for further optimization.
Your work contributes by bridging the experimental–practical gap—benchmarking **extreme quantization of EfficientNetV2** models across multiple quantization configurations and validating their edge-deployment feasibility through real-world evaluation.
