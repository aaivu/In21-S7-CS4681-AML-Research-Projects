## Data

This directory contains the custom JSON annotation files used for the experiments.

All experiments use the **COCO 2017 dataset** with the standard **Karpathy split**. The original COCO images and the base Karpathy annotation files are publicly available and not included here.

The files in this directory correspond to the three custom experimental configurations:
