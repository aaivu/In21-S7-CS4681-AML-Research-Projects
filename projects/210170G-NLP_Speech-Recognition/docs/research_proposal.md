## Abstract

Recent advancements in **self-supervised learning (SSL)** have transformed automatic speech recognition (ASR), with models like **Wav2Vec2.0** achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, these models often struggle in **low-resource environments** where training data is limited or domain-shifted. This research proposes to enhance Wav2Vec2’s adaptability and efficiency through two novel contributions:  
(1) an **Inter-Codebook Similarity Loss (ICSL)** to improve pretraining efficiency by reducing redundancy between codebooks, and  
(2) **Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)** to refine latent speech representations during fine-tuning.  
Experiments on a 10-hour subset of the LibriSpeech corpus will evaluate the methods using **contrastive loss, CTC loss, and word error rate (WER)**.  
The expected outcome is a more **data-efficient and faster-converging ASR model**, advancing the accessibility of high-performance speech recognition for low-resource languages and specialized domains.

## 1. Introduction

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays a critical role in natural language processing applications such as virtual assistants, accessibility systems, and multilingual communication.  
Recent breakthroughs like **Wav2Vec2.0**, **HuBERT**, and **WavLM** leverage SSL to learn rich representations from unlabeled audio. However, these models are **data-hungry** and **computationally demanding**, limiting their effectiveness in **low-resource settings** such as minority languages or child speech.  
This research focuses on improving the **efficiency and adaptability** of SSL-based speech recognition models, aiming to make cutting-edge ASR techniques more practical and inclusive.

## 2. Problem Statement

While SSL models like Wav2Vec2.0 achieve exceptional results with large datasets, they exhibit reduced performance in **low-resource and domain-shifted** contexts due to:
- Limited data for fine-tuning,
- Redundant or collapsed codebook representations,
- High computational requirements during training.

**Problem:**  
*How can we enhance the training efficiency and adaptability of Wav2Vec2.0 for low-resource speech recognition without increasing model size or computational cost?*

## 3. Literature Review Summary

Recent literature highlights several key directions:
- **Self-supervised frameworks** (Wav2Vec2.0, HuBERT, WavLM) enable generalizable speech representations.  
- **Adapter-based fine-tuning** (Thomas et al., 2022) and **distillation** (Chang et al., 2022) improve efficiency but do not address redundancy in quantized representations.  
- **Residual quantization methods** (Zeghidour et al., 2021) have shown success in audio compression but remain underexplored in ASR fine-tuning.

**Identified Gaps:**
1. Lack of mechanisms to reduce **inter-codebook redundancy** in multi-codebook SSL models.  
2. Limited exploration of **residual quantization** to improve adaptability under data-scarce conditions.

## 4. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To improve the **training efficiency and adaptability** of the Wav2Vec2 model in **low-resource speech recognition** through enhanced pretraining and fine-tuning techniques.

### Secondary Objectives
- Implement **Inter-Codebook Similarity Loss (ICSL)** to promote diverse and efficient codebook usage during pretraining.  
- Integrate **Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)** to refine latent representations during fine-tuning.  
- Evaluate the proposed methods on **low-resource LibriSpeech subsets** using standard ASR metrics.  
- Analyze convergence rates and model stability compared to baseline Wav2Vec2.

## 5. Methodology

The proposed approach consists of two phases:

1. **Pretraining Enhancement with ICSL**  
   - Modify the Wav2Vec2 pretraining objective by adding an inter-codebook similarity loss term to penalize redundant embeddings across multiple codebooks.  
   - Evaluate its effect on convergence speed and contrastive loss.

2. **Fine-Tuning with RVQ**  
   - Introduce a Residual Vector Quantization module between the embedding layer and CTC head during fine-tuning.  
   - Examine its impact on representation quality and fine-tuning efficiency.

**Dataset:**  
A 10-hour clean subset of the **LibriSpeech corpus** filtered for utterances ≥5 seconds.  

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
Contrastive Loss (pretraining), CTC Loss, and Word Error Rate (WER).

**Tools & Frameworks:**  
PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Librosa, NumPy, TorchAudio.  

**Hardware:**  
NVIDIA P100 GPU (16 GB) environment on Kaggle.
