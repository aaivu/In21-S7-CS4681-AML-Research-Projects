## Abstract

This literature review surveys Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and its extensions, places HER inside the broader field of goal-conditioned and multi-goal reinforcement learning (RL), and connects these ideas to human-in-the-loop and interactive problem-solving scenarios. The review covers the original HER formulation, theoretical links to goal-conditioned value functions, major practical extensions (curriculum-guided relabeling, prioritized/energy-based replay, demonstrations, bias-reduced multi-step HER, and generalized hindsight), and work that grounds hindsight-style relabeling with human inputs or natural-language goals.

**Key findings:** HER is a simple, widely-used method to overcome sparse rewards in multi-goal tasks and pairs naturally with off-policy algorithms (e.g., DDPG, TD3, SAC). Later work improves sampling of relabeled transitions, reduces bias, and extends relabeling to language or human guidance. However, open gaps remain for interactive human-AI problem solving, including integrating interactive human corrections, grounding natural-language goals at scale, and understanding statistical biases introduced by hindsight relabeling.

## 1. Introduction

Goal-conditioned and multi-goal RL aims to learn policies that can reach arbitrary goals provided at test time. A persistent challenge is sparse rewards—many real-world goals give reward only on success, making naive exploration impractical. 

**Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)** relabels failed episodes with goals that were actually achieved (so the episode becomes successful for that alternate goal), turning sparse signals into useful training data and dramatically improving sample efficiency for off-policy learners in multi-goal tasks (notably demonstrated in robotic manipulation). HER is thus especially relevant for interactive problem solving where goals may be underspecified, changing, or supplied/adjusted by humans.

## 3. Key Areas of Research

### 3.1 Core Idea and Original Contribution (HER)

Hindsight Experience Replay (Andrychowicz et al., 2017) introduced the idea of relabeling transitions with alternative goals (typically states actually reached later in the episode) so that unsuccessful episodes become useful training data for other goals. HER is algorithm-agnostic for off-policy learners and acts as an implicit curriculum: early training focuses on easier-to-achieve relabeled goals, enabling progress toward harder, original goals. Experiments in robotic manipulation showed large sample-efficiency gains in sparse-reward tasks.

**Key Papers:**
- Andrychowicz et al., 2017 — *Hindsight Experience Replay* — introduces HER, demonstrates DDPG+HER for robotic tasks and sparse rewards.

### 3.2 Theoretical Foundations: Goal-Conditioned Value Functions & UVFA

HER builds on the idea of goal-conditioned value functions (policies/value functions conditioned on a goal). The Universal Value Function Approximator (UVFA) formalizes value functions over state–goal pairs, enabling generalization across goals. HER can be seen as a practical relabeling trick that leverages goal-conditioned function approximators to reuse episodes for many goals.

**Key Papers:**
- Schaul et al., 2015 — *Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFAs)* — formalizes goal-conditioned value functions.

### 3.3 Variants and Practical Improvements to HER

Researchers have proposed many modifications to HER to improve performance or reduce side effects:

**Generalized hindsight / advantage-based relabeling:** Techniques that relabel with goals and adjust the learning objective (e.g., generalized hindsight relabeling, advantage-informed relabeling) to improve signal quality.

**Curriculum-guided HER:** Sample relabeled experiences not uniformly but based on goal-proximity or curiosity measures to create an adaptive curriculum for replay. This improves efficiency by prioritizing more informative pseudo-goals.

**Prioritization & energy-based replay:** Prioritize hindsight experiences (e.g., by trajectory energy or TD-error) to focus replay on more useful episodes.

**HER + demonstrations / human data:** Combining HER with demonstrations or human trajectories to better overcome exploration and bootstrap learning in sparse domains. (Several empirical implementations and codebases exist.)

**Bias-reduction / multi-step HER:** Methods to account for off-policy/multi-step biases introduced by naive relabeling and to make n-step updates compatible with hindsight relabeling.

**Key Papers / Sources:**
- Generalized Hindsight for RL (2020) — extends relabeling strategies.
- Curriculum-guided Hindsight Experience Replay (Fang et al., NeurIPS) — adaptive selection for relabeled episodes.
- Energy-Based Hindsight Experience Prioritization (Zhao et al.) — prioritize replay using physical trajectory energy.

### 3.4 Hindsight + Human Input, Language, and Interactive Problem Solving

Recent works explore grounding relabeled goals in higher-level representations (e.g., natural language) and incorporating human instructions/preferences so hindsight relabeling can leverage human-specified or human-corrected goals:

**Grounding hindsight instructions** connects natural-language goal instructions to multi-goal RL and uses hindsight-style relabeling to interpret partial or ambiguous instructions. This is especially relevant when humans provide goals in language or through corrections.

**Human preference learning and interactive feedback** (Christiano et al., 2017; follow-up HITL surveys) provide frameworks to shape rewards or goals by human evaluations—combining preference-based signals with hindsight relabeling is a promising direction for interactive problem solving.

**Key Papers:**
- Wermter et al./Hamburg group — *Grounding Hindsight Instructions in Multi-Goal RL* (recent work on language grounding).
- Christiano et al., 2017 — *Deep RL from human preferences* — foundation for preference-based and human-in-the-loop RL.

## 4. Research Gaps and Opportunities

The HER literature is rich, but important gaps remain—especially for interactive human–AI problem solving.

### Gap 1: Integrating Online Human Corrections and Preferences with Hindsight Relabeling

**Why it matters:** Real interactive settings (e.g., collaborative robotics, tutoring systems) involve humans giving corrections, partial goals, or preferences during learning or execution. HER currently relabels based on what the agent achieved, not on what a human intended or how a human might reframe a failed attempt.

**How your project addresses it:** Design a hybrid relabeling scheme that (a) accepts human-provided alternative goals or corrections (in structured or natural-language form), (b) relabels experiences with human-refined goals, and (c) integrates preference-based signals (pairwise comparisons or scalar feedback) to weight the replay buffer. Evaluate in simulated interactive tasks (e.g., collaborative block-arrangement) to quantify sample efficiency and alignment.

### Gap 2: Grounding Natural-Language Goals and Instructions for Hindsight Relabeling

**Why it matters:** Humans naturally specify goals/instructions in language. Current HER methods assume goals are state-descriptors (e.g., positions). Bridging language and state goals enables more natural human-AI collaboration.

**How your project addresses it:** Combine language grounding modules (e.g., goal encoders or contrastive language–state models) with hindsight relabeling: when an episode achieves a state, automatically generate corresponding natural-language descriptions (via learned grounding) and use these as relabeled goals—also allow humans to confirm/correct these labels interactively. Evaluate grounding fidelity and downstream RL performance. (See work on grounding hindsight instructions for starting points.)

### Gap 3: Statistical Bias and Off-Policy Multi-Step Learning with HER

**Why it matters:** Naive relabeling can introduce off-policy bias, especially for n-step updates or when combining with off-policy multi-step targets. This can harm stability or asymptotic performance.

**How your project addresses it:** Implement bias-reduced multi-step HER variants and test combinations with modern off-policy algorithms (TD3, SAC) and replay prioritization. Use ablation studies to identify when bias emerges and how to mitigate it (reweighting, importance sampling, or conservative backup strategies).

## 5. Theoretical Framework

The proposed research sits at the intersection of:

**Goal-conditioned RL / UVFA:** Policies and value functions conditioned on a goal representation (state vector or language embedding). This is the representational backbone that allows relabeling to be meaningful.

**Experience relabeling (HER family):** Treating any achieved final state as an alternate goal to extract additional learning signal from sparse-reward episodes.

**Human-in-the-Loop / Preference-based learning:** Modeling human corrections/preferences as additional reward signals or constraints that shape which relabeled experiences are prioritized. Christiano et al.'s preference learning provides a scalable framework to incorporate limited human feedback.

Formally, we view learning as optimizing a goal-conditioned Bellman backup for goals *g* sampled either from the environment, from hindsight (achieved states), or from human feedback/annotations. The replay distribution becomes a mixture (environment goals, hindsight goals, human-proposed goals) and must be handled carefully to avoid bias.

## 6. Methodology Insights

### Common Methodologies Used in HER Literature

**Off-policy RL algorithms:** DDPG (original HER demos), TD3, SAC—HER is simplest to combine with off-policy methods because relabeled samples can be replayed without interfering with on-policy assumptions.

**Goal relabeling strategies:** Uniform future sampling (the original HER "future" strategy), nearest-goal sampling, curriculum-guided sampling, advantage-based relabeling, and energy/TDE-based prioritization.

**Demonstrations & pretraining:** Bootstrap policy learning with human/expert demonstrations, then apply HER to expand coverage.

**Evaluation domains:** MuJoCo manipulation (Fetch tasks), robotic manipulation simulators, and increasingly tasks that incorporate language grounding or human interventions.

### Which Seem Most Promising for Your Work

**Start with an off-policy base** (TD3 or SAC) + HER to get a stable, sample-efficient baseline.

**Add a human-goal channel:** Allow relabeling using human-provided goals/preferences and weight those transitions more heavily in replay. Use curriculum-guided sampling to prioritize human-supported relabeled goals early in training.

**For language grounding,** use a learned language→state encoder (contrastive or supervised) and evaluate robustness by having humans provide free-text corrections.

### Practical Tips

- Monitor off-policy bias when mixing many relabeling sources; run ablations with and without n-step returns.
- Log whether relabeled transitions improve validation success on the true goal distribution (not only relabeled goals)—this avoids overfitting to easy relabeled goals.

## 7. Conclusion

Hindsight Experience Replay is a powerful, conceptually simple technique that reuses failed rollouts by relabeling them as successes for alternate goals, dramatically improving sample efficiency in sparse-reward multi-goal tasks. Subsequent work has improved relabeling strategies (curriculum, prioritization), reduced bias for multi-step learning, and extended HER to incorporate demonstrations and grounding in language. 

For interactive human–AI problem solving, the next steps are:
1. Integrating online human corrections and preference signals into the relabeling and replay selection process
2. Grounding relabeled goals in natural language so human partners can easily inspect and correct them
3. Carefully studying statistical biases introduced by richer relabeling mixtures

A project that implements human-aware relabeling (human-proposed goals + preference weighting) and combines it with curriculum-guided replay and modern off-policy learners would be a strong contribution bridging HER and interactive problem solving.
